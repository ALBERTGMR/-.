 antarctica_aac_intro.1.desc: "만약 추방자가 연민이라는 감정을 느낄 수 있었다면, 그것은 이 땅에 새로 도착한 부족에게 향했을 것이다. 순진한 야망과 빗나간 열정으로 가득 찬 그들은 남쪽으로 향하며 섬을 하나씩 차지해 나갔다.\n\n추방자는 그들의 꿈이 재가 되고, 불과 연기가 물 위로 치솟는 것을 지켜보았다.\n\n부족은 끝자락으로 밀려났고, 더 강력한 이웃들의 그늘 아래에 초라하고 불안정한 삶을 가까스로 이어가야 했다.\n\n그러나 이러한 굴욕이 계속되도록 둘 수는 없었다.\n\n추방자는 점점 커져가는 적의를 느꼈다. 눈앞의 모든 것을 집어삼키려는 소용돌이치는 혼돈이었다.\n\n이에 맞서는 것은 희미한 희망, 어리석은 희망이었다. 고통과 증오, 실수를 넘어 이 얼어붙은 해안에서라도 무언가 좋은 것이 나타날 수 있으리라는 마지막 기대였다.\n\n혼돈과 질서, 엔트로피에 맞선 영원한 투쟁. 이는 추방자가 누구보다 잘 아는 싸움이었다. 자연이 근원적 힘이 이 동물들을 통해 펼쳐질 것이다.\n\n추방자는 혼돈, 즉 엔트로피가 승리하리라 믿었다."

 antarctica_aac_intro.2.desc: "\"Denied, denied, denied... denied...\" Julio Escudero Guzmán began flipping through the pages of the budgetary report on his desk at an ever-increasing rate. \"Denied-denied-denied-denied.\" He slammed the binder shut and tossed it across the table. \"What the fuck is this?\"\n\nAníbal Pinto Santa Cruz, chief economist of Chilean Antarctica, recoiled. \"I didn't write the God-damn thing. Don't shoot the messenger, Julio.\"\n\nGuzmán ran his shaking hands through his hair, exhaling heavily. \"You're right, you're right, but...\" He pointed a finger at Santa Cruz. \"Did they really refuse every request for a budget increase? I didn't expect you to get all of it, but at the very least, a few things. We desperately need more funding for telecommunication infrastructure, more snowcats, more construction materials. How do they expect us to weather another winter when we're squatting in freezing shacks, barely able to keep in contact with our outposts!\"\n\n\"I tried to impress upon them the need for these things, but they're tightening belts back home. The official position of Alessandri's government is that Chilean Antarctica has sufficient funding to carry it through the year 1962.\"\n\nGuzmán's face began to turn red. \"Then those penny-pinching bureaucrats should spend the winter here, see just how necessary a funding increase is!\" He stood up and paced across the room to the window. It was snowing hard outside.\n\n\"Hell, there might not even be a Chilean Antarctic by the end of 1962!\""

 antarctica_aac_intro.3.t: "The Mutineer"
 antarctica_aac_intro.3.desc: "A moment of perfect peace. Exhale slowly... focus in... drive the hips... and... \"FORE!\"\n\nCaptain José Toribio Merino sent another long drive off the stern of his cruiser. The golf ball shone brilliantly in the sun as it arced down into the icy water below. Three hundred yards at least! A new personal best. He heard scattered applause from the sailors on deck and waved to them, smiling. He loved the adulation of his men, his people.\n\nHe lined up another ball, pondering as he did how a mutineer could come so far. He swung, and as he did so, he remembered. It was June, 1958. The brutish Argentines had stormed Chilean possessions, taking several islands by force. The government and military of Chile was in disarray. Someone had to act.\n\n\"Fore!\" Swing. Splash. The Argentines spread like a cancer, seizing everything within reach, even Antarctic holdings. Merino and his leal men could not stand by and do nothing while their countrymen bled, so he led a mutiny, taking a flotilla south. At least they would go down fighting.\n\nMerino sent another ball into the deep. The unthinkable happened: they ambushed the Argentine fleet off Greenwich island, catching them with their pants down, in the process of assaulting Arturo Pratt base. The fire was fierce, guns belching smoke and fire over the frozen water. The men of Chile gave everything they had, but it was not enough, so Merino led his cruiser in a ramming action to at least drag the foe down to the depths with him. Miraculously, the maneuver worked, and they drove off the perfidious Argentines.\n\nAs Merino lined up his last ball, he thought not of the past, but of the future, of the glory still to claim..."

 antarctica_aac_intro.4.t: "The Diplomats"
 antarctica_aac_intro.4.desc: "Chilean Antarctica's lifeline on the mainland was the port of Punta Arenas. Most supplies and personnel heading to and from Chile's southernmost possession had to transit through the port, or be airlifted.\n\nThis crucial facility for Antarctic affairs necessitated offices for government officials and military personnel involved.\n\nIn a nondescript room in the town hall, Marcial Mora Miranda and Enrique Gajardo Villarroel discussed the future of the Chilean Antarctic territory.\n\nBoth men had taken a leading role in the Chilean delegation during the disastrous negotiations that precipitated the scramble for Antarctica, and had emerged wiser for it, eager to correct their mistakes.\n\n\"So, I think that just about covers it,\" said Miranda, closing his briefcase. \"We'll fly to Arturo Prat Base, fill in Professor Guzmán first, then start with Uruguay.\"\n\n\"What do you think Guzmán will say?\" Villarroel asked.\n\n\"He'll understand that we don't have any other choice. At this point, going hat in hand to the Organization of American States is the only way we can secure international recognition for our Antarctic claims. The only other option would be a military one, and that my friend, is no option at all.\"\n\n\"A good old charm offensive, then. Wining and dining with the leaders of a continent. What could go wrong? At any rate, I don't think things could get much worse.\" Villarroel shut his briefcase and the two men departed for Antarctica."

 antarctica_aac_intro.5.t: "Morning in Arturo Prat"
 antarctica_aac_intro.5.desc: "The shuffling and jumbling of papers was all that one might have heard if they passed by a closeted little cubicle in Arturo Prat Base. One of many, but when it came to being the busiest this morning, there was no doubt who it belonged to. Carlos González Jaksic.\n\nHe traced his overused pen along a budget book. It scraped its last bits of ink onto the paper, then ran dry. Jaksic clicked the useless pen hopelessly, before dropping into the trash bin. He turned back to the book, with its rows and rows of numbers without answers to his problem. Chile's Antarctic Territory had no money.\n\nHe closed the book and set it with the rest. There was not a single penny he could scrape out of them. Jaksic shook his head, pacing around the creaking box he liked calling his office. Cold air slipped through thin, wooden walls so close together he didn't have the space to stretch his arms. This was what their budget could pay for. Santiago must have thought it was all they needed.\n\nTo hell with the cold, Jaksic thought. His aching legs popped as he stepped outside, enjoying the novelty of seeing something other than numbers. Golden light washed over glaciers and rocky roads. It was as sunny as Antarctica could be. Yet it was still not equal to a morning in his native Punta Arenas. That is where he managed the supplies coming to the territory. But also where he could enjoy being a professor. Where he worked for the Socialist Party. Where his family waited.\n\nLater today he'd take a plane back home to that life. But right now was his life of ice and snow in Arturo Prat. He took one last breath of morning air, and returned inside."

 antarctica_aac_intro.6.t: "Shivers and Prospectives"
 antarctica_aac_intro.6.desc: "It was snowing again, although the season was typically dry. The lazy wind bringing the flakes to Guzmán's window was creeping in, and he suddenly shivered as the temperature dropped again.\n\nHe cursed against the aging installation he worked in, against the government who refused to take the necessary steps to support the territory, against the horrid weather. He resolved to take a break from his curses, however momentary, and went for an early stroll through Arturo Prat Base, to make sure everything was alright.\n\nThese days the prospect of war loomed large no matter where one looked: naval guns firmly pointed towards the enemy isles, white-painted bunkers slowly being covered in snow, anti-air batteries with their crew always ready to jump into action, additional camo nets being deployed to make up for the lack of white paint, which was needed to repaint the bright red buildings many still lived in.\n\nIt felt like everyone was ready to resist a siege, and it filled Guzmán's heart with resolve. The men he led were resolved to fight back against anything that was thrown their way.\n\nIt was, at the same time, a fragile situation. Who could say what would happen if a sudden storm stranded the garrison or if their obsolete radios were unable to request reinforcements if the Argentines attacked? The strength of Arturo Prat Base was built on the confidence that had accumulated since the Snipe Incident. If something shattered that confidence..."
 antarctica_aac_intro.6.a: "Guzmán shivered once more as he made his way back to his office."
 antarctica_aac_intro.7.t: "A Captain Marooned in Politics"
 antarctica_aac_intro.7.desc: "Captain Merino loved being underway. His time at sea liberated him from the officers' game that was played on terra firma. All that mattered was his crew and the mission. The Captain Prat was a fine fighting ship. American made, it had served in the Pacific during the war before being sold to the Chilean Navy in 1951. Dozens of guns, thick ice-strengthened armor, and a floatplane launcher system made it the equal of any Argentine ship in these waters. Merino knew this for a fact of course, he had commandeered the ship during his heroic effort against the Argentine during Snipe, thwarting their total annexation of Chilean Antarctic holdings. Yes, the Captain Prat was a fine ship.\n\nIts Captain sat in the officers' mess; he preferred to eat late. Much to the dismay of the chefs. Every other meal he was bombarded by his cadre. Dinner, however, provided him with solitude that was rare to come by on a vessel. The meal consisted of steak and potatoes, with a hot cup of tea to boot. However, it failed to ease his anxiety. The precarious situation of the Chilean slice of Antarctica was on his mind day and night.\n\nThe Navy's summer patrol had finally concluded, the ships returning to their Chilean homeport. He dreaded his debrief meeting with Professor Guzmán. The professor-turned-administrator had Captain Merino at his wits' end.\n\nCaptain Merino would emphasize over and over to Professor Guzmán that their military was the only thing keeping their claim afloat. But the Professor didn't care, instead worrying about \"reducing the deficit\" and staffing his command with socialists like Jaksic. His father, a vice admiral, taught him to keep politics out of the military, but the situation was becoming desperate."
 antarctica_aac_intro.7.a: "Not the academy nor his father could have ever prepared him for these strange times."
 antarctica_aac_intro.8.t: "The Meeting"
 antarctica_aac_intro.8.desc: "The cruiser Arturo Prat sheltered in the lee of Arturo Prat Base, on Greenwich Island. Its Captain, José Merino, disembarked with all pomp and circumstance and received the best welcome Prat Base could give, which wasn't much. The welcoming ceremony took place in the shadow of the huge naval guns placed to ward off Argentine encroachment. Merino looked upon them with approval; he had, after all, ordered their installation. The belts of trenches and bunkers were likewise his brainchild, and were kept in a state of high maintenance, as they should be. The Argentine was a slimy worm, ever burrowing, searching for weakness.\n\nThe civilians, on the other hand, were a disappointment. The motley spattering of run-down buildings were a testament to their undisciplined inhabitants. What made him angry, however, was the state of the barracks: rusted and ramshackle. Simply undignified quarters for his comrades.\n\nHe met with Professor Guzmán in his dingy office, regarding the man distantly. \"Do you have good news for me?\" Merino asked.\n\nGuzmán shook his head. \"Unfortunately, Captain, the government has refused all budgetary requests for the duration of the year. We'll have to make do-\"\n\n\"Make do?\" Merino interrupted. \"Don't you idiots understand, the enemy is at our doorstep, waiting to strike!\"\n\n\"I'm no happier about it than you, but what could we do?\"\n\n\"You could've done your damn job!\" Merino poured himself a drink from Guzmán's private stores. There wasn't a sign of protest. \"This is deeply troubling, deeply troubling, but I will make do... as you ask.\""
 antarctica_aac_intro.8.a: "\"Now, where are my quarters?\""
 antarctica_aac_main.1.t: "Coming and Going"
 antarctica_aac_main.1.desc: "Landing at Arturo Prat's \"airport\" was anything but smooth. Marcial Miranda and Enrique Villarroel bounced off the walls of their prop plane as they touched down on the icy, unpaved runway. The plane shuddered to a halt, throwing the diplomats one final time. \"I always look forward to that,\" Miranda remarked sardonically.\n\nVillarroel opted not to speak; wise, considering how green his face was.\n\nThe pilot cut the engine and the ground crew secured the plane, allowing the diplomats to step out into the cold. That first bite of wind was always the worst. It struck you and ripped your breath away. Miranda and Villarroel waited for the world to stop spinning before descending onto the runway and heading for the compound.\n\nOn the way, they ran into the newest member of Chilean Antarctica's leadership, Carlos Jaksic. \"Welcome back!\" he said with a smile.\n\nThe diplomats returned it tacitly. They were still unsure what to make of Jaksic. The man had yet to prove himself equal to his task here. They noted the duffel bags in his hands. \"Where are you off to?\" Villarroel asked, finally able to speak.\n\n\"Back the way you came.\" Jaksic nodded to the plane, which was being refueled. \"I'm heading home to Punta Arenas to make some logistical arrangements, maybe catch supper with my family. You?\"\n\n\"We're here to see the Professor,\" said Miranda. \"We think we have a plan that might just get us out of our bind.\" He gestured broadly around at the base.\n\nJaksic shook their hands. \"Well, I wish you the best of luck, gentlemen. I suppose I'll see you some other time.\" He strode off toward the runway."
 antarctica_aac_main.1.a: "The diplomats hurried to meet Guzmán, so they could soon follow Jaksic's lead northwards."
 antarctica_aac_main.2.t: "A Decision to Be Made"
 antarctica_aac_main.2.desc: "The way Captain Merino walked about, between the trenches and anti-air guns, and was greeted by the soldiers, suggested more a popular figure than an officer rigidly commanding his troops. Each time he passed by one of his men, he saluted, encouraging, teasing, and finding a good word to cheer him up.\n\nMorale was high and the garrison was not letting its guard down: with Merino, victor of the previous encounter, at their head, the odds of losing to the Fascists shrank in the mind of each Chilean soldier. Seeing the consistency with which he inspected the base, and the energy with which he requested reinforcements or new guns was heart-warming to them. It made the officer the foundation of Arturo Prat Base: the soldiers did not rest their faith in concrete bunkers or in steel machine guns, or in the civilians supposedly commanding the base, but rather in one man, a soldier like them. And that man knew how important he was.\n\nCaptain Merino lived with the prospect that the base depended on him to survive, and that fact made him proud, but it chilled his bones, too. He knew Arturo Prat Base was underprepared, and he feared the Argentines would have an easy time taking it over. He desperately wanted to conduct a general inspection in the coming months, but the fear that no one would listen to his pleas for help and reinforcement still lingered. And if the garrison realized the state of disarray of its base... he preferred not to think about it.\n\nInstead, he thought, it would be best to start to fix what could be fixed now: it wouldn't make up for new radios or more ammunition, but it was all he could do. He began to walk towards the naval battery, as he used to do when the gunners needed a tip from an old sailor on how to prevent the battery from decalibrating, but then noticed how the trenches running atop the hill were slowly filled by the eroding concrete of the nearby casemates. It seemed urgent to fix, but re-digging trenches was never an enjoyable job, especially given the way the shovels looked these days. For a moment, Captain Merino pondered his options."
 antarctica_aac_main.2.a: "Attempting to ignore the crumbling fortifications, he continued to walk to the battery. "

 antarctica_aac_main.3.t: "Far Away From Here"
 antarctica_aac_main.3.desc: "Professor Guzmán shook Miranda and Villarroel's hands as they entered his office. \"I see you survived the flight,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\"It's always such a pleasant experience,\" Miranda said dryly, as they all took a seat around Guzmán's desk.\n\nGuzmán poured them each a drink. \"So, what's this all about? Have you made a breakthrough?\"\n\n\"We've made a plan,\" said Miranda.\n\n\"We'll know in a few weeks if it's a breakthrough,\" said Villarroel.\n\n\"Tell me about it.\" Guzmán sipped his drink and studied the diplomats.\n\n\"We desperately need more international recognition for our nation's claims. Frankly, Argentina has outmaneuvered us. We need to concentrate our efforts,\" continued Miranda, \"on the members of the Organization of American States.\"\n\n\"We're going to scaffold up support, starting with Uruguay.\" Villarroel chimed in. \"Afterwards, we'll conduct a string of diplomatic missions across the Caribbean. Peru and Ecuador are also possibilities.\"\n\n\"Building up momentum will be crucial, like a snowball rolling downhill. The more nations we get to support our legal claims, the more will see reason and follow.\"\n\n\"A good plan,\" said Guzmán, then grinned. \"I notice it takes you far away from here.\"\n\n\"Just because we fight for our nation's right to these lands,\" said Miranda, \"doesn't mean we have to spend time here.\""
 antarctica_aac_main.3.a: "\"We'll go over the diplomatic briefs on Uruguay in a few weeks,\" said Villarroel."
 antarctica_aac_main.4.t: "Stroll to the Town Hall"
 antarctica_aac_main.4.desc: "Light sparked before Carlos González Jaksic's face. His cigarette smoke drifted past him, carried off by a cool seaside breeze. The road trudged along a soft hill of tallgrass before Punta Arenas rose over the coast. Far away, the regular supply shipments to Antarctica sailed past distant mountains.\n\nRegular, yet always insufficient. Jaksic sighed and took a long drag on his cigarette. Nobody back in the territory could afford for him to come up short here. Although his political reach in the mainland was finite, Jaksic's hands were not completely tied.\n\nOld, refined houses stood by each side of the road as he descended into town. He left behind swaying grass and humming bugs and was welcomed by paved, still streets. An old dog barked in the distance. Otherwise things were quiet, as usual for Punta Arenas. Quiet was one of many things Jaksic enjoyed about his hometown. But other regional politicians disagreed.\n\nPunta Arenas is yet another provincial town, starving for Santiago's attention. It's key role as a supply point to Antarctica is a sole exception. In that way, Punta Arenas' relevance depends on Antarctica just as Antarctica depends on it for supplies. Jaksic could convince the councilmen to shave some of the local budget and give it to Antarctica. On the other hand, he could have them agitate in Santiago, and put his cause on the national stage.\n\nOr he could simply be honest. The Chilean Antarctic Territory was on the border of bankruptcy, and they desperately needed help. Jaksic entered the town hall, his decision made."
 antarctica_aac_main.4.a: "Surely Punta Arenas can afford to lend some money to the Antarctic project. For our mutual benefit."
 antarctica_aac_main.4.b: "The councilmen will be our voice in the capital. They have contacts they can pressure."
 antarctica_aac_main.4.c: "Emphasizing the gravity of the situation is the only way to convince them. It'll hurt our long term legitimacy, but we need help."
 antarctica_aac_main.5.t: "The Last Patrol"
 antarctica_aac_main.5.desc: "Captain Merino was glad to be leaving Arturo Prat behind. Aside from its defences, there wasn't anything to recommend the base. He'd leave Guzmán to freeze on the damp island while he made for the frontline at Bernardo O'Higgins Base.\n\nGuzmán had no concept of the struggle that was to come. Let him play at diplomacy, and let men like Merino take action.\n\nOf course, there were no men quite like Merino, but at least there were a few patriots manning their posts in this Godforsaken archipelago.\n\nCaptain Merino led from the bridge of the cruiser, Arturo Prat, as they made way. The waves crashed against the hull as they entered the open ocean. This was where Merino had once before defeated the hated foe, and here he would defeat them again.\n\nThe men under his command needed to be honed for the battle ahead. They would be his sword, cutting a bloody swathe through the Argentinians. They might be outnumbered, but they would fight like cornered lions. For every Chilean that fell, ten Argentines would meet their maker, whatever slimy creature that was.\n\nDreams of glory would have to wait until after winter, however. It was foolish to attempt to navigate these waters when it started to choke with icebergs and crusted over, metres thick.\n\nHe had to send the bulk of his fleet home, to Punta Arenas, Puerto Williams, and further north to Valparaíso. The question on his mind was, should he retain some of the lighter support vessels that could patrol these waters for a while longer before the sea froze, or send the majority of his forces home, conserving resources."
 antarctica_aac_main.5.a: "The Argentines can smell weakness. Keep patrolling the waters for as long as we can."
 antarctica_aac_main.5.b: "We need to conserve our resources for the right moment when we can strike decisively. Let us not succumb to attrition."
 antarctica_aac_main.6.t: "Quid Pro Quo"
 antarctica_aac_main.6.desc: "Professor Guzmán spent more time writing than a medieval monk. The volume of correspondence required to keep Chile's holdings on Antarctica functioning beggared the imagination.\n\nMountains of papers demanding resupply, better living conditions, more ammunition and weaponry, everyone wanted something.\n\nSo it was a pleasant surprise, therefore, to find a polite request amongst the peaks of the paper stacks. Resembling an almost-quid-pro-quo, a marked departure from his usual missives, the letter was from the University of Chile.\n\nThe letter was a petition to install a multi-discipline team of scientists at Arturo Prat for the remainder of 1962, in exchange for the University throwing whatever political weight it had in the capital behind Guzmán's operations. Geologists, meteorologists, paleontologists, biologists, seemingly every \"ologist\" in Chile wanted a spot at the base.\n\nGuzmán chuckled. They had no idea what they were signing up for. Arturo Prat had outdated facilities and cold, substandard living quarters. The scientists would have to weather the winter almost immediately upon arrival: an extremely daunting prospect for the uninitiated.\n\nAnd that was even if he allowed them to come. Arturo Prat Base and all of Chilean Antarctica was operating on a razor-thin supply margin. Provisions were tight, and the scientists would have to pull their weight with other tasks during the season.\n\nOn the other hand, it was an unparalleled opportunity to prove the worth of Chilean Antarctica. Professor Guzmán drafted his reply."
 antarctica_aac_main.6.a: "\"Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate the increase in personnel for this year.\""
 antarctica_aac_main.6.b: "\"We at Arturo Prat would be happy to host our nation's best and brightest.\""
 antarctica_aac_main.7.t: "Sunbathing"
 antarctica_aac_main.7.desc: "When the indoors grew too stifling, Professor Guzmán went outside into the frigid air.\n\nHe wouldn't have many more chances to catch the sun: between the onset of winter and the hours of effort he would doubtless put in working with Miranda and Villarroel on their diplomatic scheme, this was one of his last opportunities to sunbathe.\n\n\"Sunbathe\" being a somewhat inaccurate description, as he was bundled up in numerous insulating layers. Guzmán knew well how the coming winter would affect everyone's morale, including his own.\n\nBouts of depression were a real concern during the dark season, when the sun dwindled and then almost vanished entirely for months at a time.\n\nGuzmán spotted a group of the soldiers playing a game of football on a flat spot outside the base.\n\nOne by one they turned to give him the evil eye as he passed. He wasn't well-liked because, in their eyes, he was failing as their leader. The base was chafing under the budget constraints, and during Guzmán's time involved in Antarctic affairs, he'd only presided over losses.\n\nThe men surely think I'm cursed, he thought. And if they hadn't come to that conclusion themselves, Captain Merino surely convinced them of such.\n\nGuzmán grabbed a chair and watched the game. Eventually, the soldiers forgot about him and went back to playing.\n\nGuzmán knew he would have a chance to prove himself to the men in the coming months. There was a future for Chilean Antarctica..."
 antarctica_aac_main.7.a: "Even if no one else yet saw it."
 antarctica_aac_main.8.t: "The Chatterer"
 antarctica_aac_main.8.desc: "Cht-cht-cht-cht. Professor Guzmán's teeth wouldn't stop chattering.\n\nThis was fucking ridiculous.\n\nHe'd tugged on three pairs of woolen socks, two sets of long underwear, put on his heaviest winter coat, and he was still cold. The damp air found its way in through the poorly insulated domicile. Another victim of the budget.\n\nGuzmán reached for his coffee. It was nearly impossible to get a good grip on the cup with his mittens on, but he refused to take them off. Inches from his mouth, the cup slipped as another shiver wracked his body, and the scalding liquid landed in his lap. Ahh... warmth at last.\n\nSoon, even the momentary respite afforded by the spilled beverage dissipated in the Antarctic winter, and Guzmán was forced to put on a new pair of clothes.\n\nThis winter had been harder than the last. They were consuming food and fuel at a faster clip than before. Guzmán figured the deteriorating state of the base's facilities meant they had to eat more and burn more to stay active and warm. What deeply troubled Guzmán was that they were only around a month into the winter.\n\nHe envied Villarroel and Miranda, hell, even Jaksic got to spend winter back home with his family in Punta Arenas. Ironically, the only kindred spirit amongst the leadership was Captain Merino, who was wintering over in O'Higgins Base.\n\nCht-cht-cht-cht. Guzmán's teeth began their usual song. He was painfully aware of the need to conserve fuel, but God damn it, he was the leader of the base and he had work to do! A few extra layers might suffice, but a few extra degrees would be even better."
 antarctica_aac_main.8.a: "This will be a tough winter. Who knows what might happen? I'll just tough it out."

 antarctica_aac_main.9.t: "O'Higgins Base"
 antarctica_aac_main.9.desc: "Now this, Captain Merino thought, is what a Chilean base should be, armed to the teeth, and spoiling for a fight. O'Higgins Base stood defiant against the Argentine foe.\n\nThe base was Merino's baby. He'd overseen the development of the landward and seaward defences in the years since the Snipe Incident. Even skyward; O'Higgins Base bristled with AA guns.\n\nAny Argentine force would find the base one hell of a tough nut to crack, even if it was a combined arms operation.\n\nWhat was left wanting, however, was the offensive capability of the base. He would spend the rest of the year, perhaps longer, developing it. The soldiers Merino was inspecting were in satisfactory condition. They clung to their training and discipline, knew how to present themselves well, but they were not yet up to the standard of Antarctic warfare.\n\nIn drills during the past month, he'd assessed what they were capable of, and they'd been found wanting in several respects.\n\nMost of the men were marines assigned to Merino's flotilla and were not yet used to the weather. They performed sluggishly, and many showed an inability to deal with the environmental conditions during survival training. An opposing force, already acclimatized to the region, could easily outmaneuver Merino's men. That would have to change. His men needed to be able to travel hundreds of kilometres across this deadly land, fight at the other end, then return. It would take some time to prepare the men for this style of warfare, but Merino was confident they were up to the task, given the right instructor.\n\nFor the moment, the marines assembled before Merino needed a task. He was happy to oblige."

His wife lighting up the room with every flash of her smile. Punta Arenas wasn't exactly paradise during the winter, but it was a damn sight warmer than Antarctica.\n\nJaksic felt slightly guilty; Professor Guzmán was probably freezing his balls off right about now. He just hoped that the pathetic budget foisted upon them didn't result in any mishaps down south.\n\nOn the matter of the budget, he'd continued to work unceasingly. The prospects for the future seemed grim, to put it mildly. Even if they made it through this year with the current budget, that survival was likely to bury them.\n\nThe government would give them the same budget next year, expecting similar results. They would not receive them. The Professor had made perfectly clear the rapidly deteriorating equipment on-base would barely last beyond the season, let alone another year.\n\nLately, however, an idea had begun percolating in Jaksic's mind. The casual strolls around town he was so fond of had brought him to the docks, and to a most interesting proposition."

The lines for food, fuel, and ammunition all spiraled into a slow free-fall across his graphs, and if something wasn't done soon the landing may very well crush the bones of Chilean Antarctica into powder.\n\nWhile Arturo Prat would hopefully remain in the green, barring any unexpected disasters, it was the margins Guzmán was more concerned with. Captain Merino's updates on the new training regiment at O'Higgins Base seemed promising, but the sheer cost in ammunition and food was cutting a cold, bloody chunk out of the rations.\n\nBut far more worrying were the x-factor of the island outposts like Wiencke and Adelaide. Those poor brave souls were left for months alone in the dark of winter with only minimal supplies. Worse, Arturo Prat had no way of checking their status, radio coverage was spotty at best, and many of the older bases didn't even have functional communications facilities. For all Guzmán knew, any number of horrific fates may have fallen upon them out there in the snow. Once summer arrived, they may find the outposts occupied only by frozen corpses or worse... Argentines.\n\nThe numbers may be against him, but Guzmán was still able to alter the calculations. He picked up his pen and began scrawling a memo for Jaksic with orders to..."
 antarctica_aac_main.11.a: "...redirect supply ships from home to O'Higgins Base once the oceans thaw; they'll need those rations and munitions more than us."

 antarctica_aac_main.12.t: "Below the Ivory Tower"
 antarctica_aac_main.12.desc: "A cold bead of sweat dripped down First Lieutenant Pablo Wunderlich's face as his teeth began to chatter. He and his men had been marching for hours now outside O'Higgins Base, pushed to the point of exhaustion. The cold of Antarctica was intense under normal circumstances, but with the coming of winter, the eternal darkness made it intolerable. Snow piled up on the ground, only to be trampled by Chilean boots over and over again. The snow would eventually win the fight, if only because the Chilean boots were unfit for the rigors of Antarctica, like almost all of their equipment. With the constant loss of equipment, it might mean in a few weeks they would be marching in their socks.\n\nWunderlich looked up to see Captain Merino standing atop an observation tower. His figure left a dark silhouette from the lights behind him, but he could feel the rage and disappointment steaming off of the Captain. Even a casual observer could see that the discipline of the marines was lacking. Many didn't march so much as limp; every few minutes, one of them would simply collapse. They would receive no help from their comrades, who were ordered to simply walk over the fallen.\n\nTheir faces did little to hide the mental toll these drills had taken, black sunken eyes and muted hateful expressions. Even in downtime, their once lively conversations had turned silent, a cloud darker than the sky above them. And that wasn't even to mention those who saw death as preferable to this cold hell...\n\nMerino looked down on these \"marines\" with a look of unambiguous disgust. Years of complacency and laziness had left these soldiers weak in spirit and body, led by brain-damaged or crypto-communist officers. At this pace, the honor of Chile would never be recovered. As much as he loathed to admit it, Merino needed help. Earlier that day, a letter had been sent back to the Bernardo O'Higgins Military Academy, requesting one of their instructors to stem the tide of degeneracy affecting the base."

 antarctica_aac_main.13.t: "Foul Thinking"
 antarctica_aac_main.13.desc: "Sheets of ice drifted along the bay around Punta Arenas. They cracked under the foam of inky ocean waves, the town's lights glimmering above. Jaksic's boots left tracks in the thin blanket of snow covering the deserted streets. Cold bit his nose as a frigid wind blew over the port. He stopped where the cobbled street ended and the wooden planks began and lit a cigarette he had saved for his walks.\n\nA blinking light drifted in the horizon. Jaksic looked with groggy eyes between the frozen bay and the waves crashing against the port, smoke swirling around him. He recalled being a child during a time when there were more lights twinkling in the sea. Ships crossing day and night, under both sun and stars. All this traffic through the Magellan Strait had dried up in favor of the Panama Canal as tensions in the south soared.\n\nThat single, blinking light is all they had. Most ships had gone and taken the money with them. Then the dockworkers went away too, leaving a ghostly shell of a pier to frost and wither in the winter. Jaksic crushed the cigarette in his hands as he walked along the restless waves. Great buildings, or at least the shells of buildings, rose over the shoreline ahead. The rusting skeletons of fisheries and abandoned entrails of once-bustling markets cast long shadows over the cracked ice.\n\nThe mirage of what these places had been was swept away by another howling wind, and Jaksic was left with the problems of today. Punta Arenas was quieter than he liked. Smaller, duller, and every day poorer. And far across the sea, the Antarctic territory trudged on with its budget problem. No matter where he went, it seemed Jaksic could only find troubled places.\n\nHe stopped, sank into his jacket, and wondered whether he could help either one. Let alone both. A second later, he straightened, an idea in mind."

 antarctica_aac_main.14.desc: "Guzmán walked swiftly down the halls of the civilian domiciles. The near perpetual night of the Antarctic Winter took its toll on people, some more than others. One of his assistants, Diego Fernandez, had been calling in sick constantly, and seldom left his bed. His absence was felt, and Guzmán had decided to check on him.\n\nKnocking on the door got no response, so Guzmán let himself in. The lights in the room were out, and the room was very messy. Scattered across the room were bottles. \"Diego?\" Guzmán asked.\n\n\"...What is it?\" said a man, slumped on the bed. Guzmán could smell alcohol on his breath.\n\n\"I was checking in to see if you need anything\" Guzmán said. Diego replied, weakly, \"I'm fine\" Guzmán, skeptical, replied \"You've been sick a lot...and I can see you've been drinking. I'm getting worried. Is there anything I can-\" Diego cut him off. \"Fuck off\"\n\nGuzmán was taken aback by his assistant's attitude. Perhaps Diego wasn't cut out for Antarctica, or at least not the winter. But there was no helping it now, winter flights were for life-and-death emergencies only. But more worrying still were the bottles. They couldn't be coming from the commissary or the bar, there were too many of them, and they all looked too different. Someone must be illegally producing alcohol on the base. Guzmán grit his teeth. The temptation to drink oneself half to death would be too great during the winter.\n\n\"Very well,\" Guzmán said. \"Come to my office when you're sober.\""

Diego nodded and said \"Yeah, I've stopped drinking. Honestly, I don't miss it\".\n\n\"That's good,\" Guzmán continued, \"I need your help. That booze you were drinking wasn't from the bar or the commissary, was it? I need to know who you were buying it from\"\n\nDiego said \"Y'know, I really can't recommend trying it, that was some shitty booze.\" Guzmán rubbed his temples.\n\n\"That's not the point! The point is that someone out there is selling alcohol illegally, and I need your help to stop it!\"\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know exactly where it's coming from. I got it from some guy in the mess hall. We've got our work cut out for us, it's very difficult to get people to stop drinking in the best of times\".\n\nGuzmán frowned. \"Yes, I know that, but this is serious. It was hard enough without the booze; now, imagine what happens when we can't do repairs because half the engineers are drunk. Or when research falls behind because our scientists are puking their guts out. Or when Argentina tries to invade when our soldiers are seeing double! That booze is a menace!\"\n\nDiego sighed. \"Ok, ok, I get it. Where do you think we should start?\" Guzmán smiled and said..."

 antarctica_aac_main.16.t: "The Boogeyman of O'Higgins"
 antarctica_aac_main.16.desc: "As First Lieutenant Wunderlich oversaw his men's morning exercises, two figures emerged out of the corner of his eye, Captain Merino and his new advisor, Luis Danús Covián, inspecting the soldiers' progress. The mere sight of normally aloof Merino joining his men in the courtyard rather than on the observation tower came as something of a shock. Merino looked mildly uncomfortable trudging through the snow when compared to the upright, unstoppable march of his new underling. Much had changed once Covián had arrived. Just as the darkness of winter was beginning to consume all, Covián emerged from an icy June storm to herald a new era for the base. Summoned on the personal request of Captain Merino, he was given the unenviable task of molding the marines of O'Higgins Base into true soldiers after a winter training that had pushed the men towards thoughts of mutiny and suicide in equal measure. He had vanquished the darkness of winter not as a beacon of light and hope but because the darkness in his shaded glasses seemed to make everything brighter in comparison.\n\nWunderlich, like many on base, had begun to fear this new arrival. While Merino had attempted to beat his men into shape with sheer force, Covián had taken a subtler approach, using pain and intimidation as a scalpel rather than a hammer. The results were seen almost immediately, with visible improvements to the discipline of the marines. Rumors of his shady past with the School of the Americas and bloody reputation back home only enhanced the mystique of Covián, as the Boogeyman of O'Higgins wormed his way from the tongues of the marines into their souls.\n\nAs Merino and Covián passed by, Wunderlich could almost make out their conversation. Covián calmly informed Merino that the constant lack of supplies was hampering the training process. Wunderlich could barely make out Merino's retort. \"You just keep doing your job...\""

 antarctica_aac_main.17.desc: "The smell of the cannery was the worst thing in the world. It sank into Jaksic's pores and clawed at his nostrils. The premises were soaked in greasy oil, and there was fish offal everywhere. His escort seemed completely unperturbed.\n\nWhen Jaksic stepped inside, he was confronted by the horrifying sight of a butchered whale. The carcass was in the process of being stripped to the bone, great saws carving off chunks of fatty flesh. Jaksic felt his stomach turn.\n\nHis guide gave him a toothless smile. \"Behold, the sea's bounty,\" he said.\n\nJaksic recoiled. He'd thought nothing could be worse than the smell of the cannery, until he caught a whiff of his guide's breath.\n\nHe was led upstairs into an administrative office situated overtop of the processing floor. It was dismal, damp, and moldy. The same could be said of its occupant. \"So,\" said the manager. \"What do you think of our operation?\"\n\n\"Not exactly my choice of workplace, but I respect the gainful employment you provide to so many of Punta Arenas' citizens.\"\n\nThe manager laughed. \"You're full of shit, Jaksic, but you're all right. I think we could do business together, if you're up for it.\"\n\n\"As I said on the phone, this is purely a fact-finding mission. Everything will have to be cleared by the Professor.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" said the manager with a grin. \"Well, why don't we show you the rest of the operation? Then you can decide what to tell your Professor. Come. I'll have the boat made ready for us.\""

 antarctica_aac_main.18.desc: "\"It's typical of them, really,\" Merino grumbled into the phone, \"happily licking Fascist boots, like always.\"\n\nGuzmán nodded on the other side of the line, finger coiled around the wire. A few minutes later he hung up. He walked over to his desk, sat down, and stared at the floor for what felt like an eternity. Argentina had leased Chilean territory to the Italian Empire. They had no right to Galindez Island, it didn't belong to them. Yet just like that it had been handed over like a piece of cake.\n\nRed filled Guzmán's vision for a moment. His knuckles went white with rage pressed over his knees. Chile could do nothing. He could do nothing. Nothing but watch their land be exchanged for money. Soon, though, that rage was extinguished by a cold and sudden awareness. Italy was the fourth strongest power in the world, and it had just joined the Antarctic arena.\n\nIt was no time to be emotional. What were their intentions? How far would they go to support Argentina? How many of them were coming? Guzmán only had partial answers. He knew Italy would be siding with the Argentines. He knew a flotilla was coming.\n\nDamn them. Always two steps ahead. All that he could do was hope that the flotilla wouldn't go so far as to intervene in their territorial dispute. Chile would already be on the backfoot if things went hot. If Italy joined against them...\n\nGuzmán sighed, and stared out the window. Arturo Prat's old buildings shone under the Antarctic morning, and a gnawing pit in his stomach told him that they were running out of time. Miranda and Villarroel would continue their diplomatic campaign. That would have to be their saving grace."

Well, now Guzmán had found it, the font of so much pain and misery on base: The source of that illegal alcohol. It was a shed, abandoned years ago, repurposed as a still. Guzmán was not without mercy or reason, though. He wished to confront the architect of his headaches personally and give them a chance to turn themselves in.\n\nHe opened the door and looked around the place. It was filthy, with rusting equipment, mold on the walls, dust, and a few bugs here and there. Various base personnel were in the middle of preparing their next batch, not noticing him until he spoke. \"It's no wonder that morale is so low if people are drinking this stuff,\" he said. Eyes turned to him.\n\nA man walked up; Guzmán recognized him as Benjamin, part of the kitchen staff. \"Look, I can explain.\" \n\n\"Explain!?\" spat Guzmán. \"Oh, please do. I want to hear how you can explain why you needed to violate protocol and sell dangerous amounts of booze during the most challenging time of year. Because about a tenth of our team is too drunk or hungover to work right now, and nothing, I mean nothing, would make me happier than clapping you in irons. It's marvelous that you've lined your pockets by threatening the health and safety of our crew. So please explain and don't disappoint me!\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Look, look, there's no stopping this. If it wasn't us, they'd be getting the booze from someone else. This way, we get to control it.

 antarctica_aac_main.20.desc: "On the edge of the Argentine border, mere kilometers from O'Higgins Base, a seemingly endless horizon of barren ice lay before Merino and Covián. In their comparatively tiny snowcat, the sheer scale of the Antarctic frontier was overwhelming.\n\nMerino pondered if this was how the conquistadors of old felt landing on the unspoiled beaches of the New World, with a whole continent lying before them ripe for conquest. Indeed just like those ancient heroes the only thing that stood in the way of Merino's dreams were a population of almost-subhuman savages: the Argentines. With some legal chicanery, ape-men of Buenos Aires had fooled the world into thinking that these lands belonged to them.\n\nMerino knew better. He turned around to see the lines of Chilean marines performing maneuver exercises and was struck with an idea. \"Covián, how ready do you think these boys are for real combat?\"\n\nCovián responded in his usual cool detached tone, \"There have been remarkable improvements in discipline and sub-zero operations, within a few months I can guarantee we will have them in peak combat readiness.\"\n\nMerino contemplated this for a moment and then turned to Covián smiling, his hand gesturing to the distance towards the Argentine border, seemingly empty and undefended. \"Perhaps that process could be expedited, nothing prepares a soldier like a brush with real danger. A brief trip away from base might do them some good\"\n\n\"Are you proposing crossing the border, Captain? If so, I must caution you, should they encounter enemy combatants...\" Merino cut him off:"

Salty sea wind whipped from the south, past jagged ice flows and frothing waves. He would have held onto something as the world rocked around him again, but the railings were so consumed in rust he feared just touching them would result in tetanus. The captain whistled, pulling him out of his thoughts. \"Would you look at that,\" he said, \"hardly come by one of those nowadays.\" He passed his binoculars to Jaksic and pointed far into the horizon. A sleek, grayish-blue creature broke through the waves. A white fountain announced its presence. Jaksic was slack-jawed. He had never seen a blue whale before. His expression steeled as he saw the flotilla of whaling boats trailing after the animal.\n\nA good captain would only need one shot, he had been told. The explosive tipped harpoon flew and struck the whale's back. It erupted into a cloud of red mist. Mushy entrails floated out of the open carcass, and the boats swarmed to shove air hoses into it to keep the body from sinking. They moved on as Jaksic's ship approached. His only comfort was that what once was a whale did not thrash or struggle as it was hauled on deck. Its fins swung limp as the hook boys approached, carving and slicing with cleaves and rusty scythes. Cascades of blood and the unrelenting stench of iron did not deter them, they plunged crooked knives through the smooth skin, mincing the largest animal on Earth into manageable chunks.\n\nThe thick blocks of blubber went one by one into the ovens, to be melted and put in barrels. Dripping flesh taller than the men swayed in meat hooks over the deck, while the bones were crushed into pounds and pounds of bone meal. Jaksic's face was a shade of green. He tried to ignore the blood covering everything up to his waist as he watched the unused viscera tossed overboard.\n\n\"Alright boys, clean up,\" the captain ordered. \"Off to the next one.\""

He picked it up. \"Guzmán here.\"\n\n\"This is Command and Control for the airfield. Captain Merino has just landed. He wasn't scheduled.

Ignominious! Fucking foul!\" He threw a handful of photos onto the desk. \"The troglodytic Argentine scum have committed murder and didn't allow us the decency of a burial! Our boys didn't have long distance radios and couldn't call for help. They died cold and alone.\"\n\nThe colour drained from Guzmán's face as Merino's grew incandescent. The photos depicted an Argentine flag flying over Wiencke Island, which before the winter, had been held by Chile. \"Are you saying the Argentinians killed our garrison on the island?\"\n\n\"Killed them, probably dumped in the ocean, and burned the outpost to the ground. All that remains is their unsightly rag. We should strike back!\"\n\nGuzmán stood up. \"You know as well as I we're in no position to do that.\"\n\nMerino looked at Jaksic with revulsion. \"And whose fault is that? Pissing socialists!

But now, the sun revealed all their mistakes. Bits of wood, rotting on decades-old facilities. He saw a metal panel fall off of one of the buildings. So much damage and disrepair accumulated over the years.\n\nGuzmán walked inside some of the buildings. All of them run down. Furniture broken, lightbulbs burnt out, rusting pipes. The crew was little better. They were disheveled, and there was something in the way they held their eyes that Guzmán could read... they were done. He couldn't blame them. They'd been through hell. But now that they could, Guzmán suspected a lot of them would be heading home now.\n\nIt was, in some ways, a worrying thought. So many experienced men, all gone. But Guzmán reassured himself, new men would come.\n\nLooking at some of the dilapidated equipment and buildings, he considered that maybe getting new things wouldn't be so bad. Perhaps a transfusion of fresh blood was exactly what they needed. New enthusiasm, new perspectives, new ideas. That, Guzmán concluded, was exactly what would win them the day.\n\nGuzmán looked at the horizon, a smile forming on his face as he found the silver lining.

Where mere months ago this lot would have been filled with weepy eyed slouchers, they had been replaced with a human wall of discipline. All stood up perfectly straight, their clothes and weapons in as best condition that the weather would allow. Even their beards were perfectly shaved, not a millimeter over official Chilean regulation. As the light of a December summer waxed over this icy desert, the marine corps seemed to be reborn with newfound vigor. It wouldn't be long now, until his plans could be put into action.\n\nSuddenly, Covián stuck his hand out into the crowd, pointing at a lone soldier. \"Step forward First Sailor García.\" The marine's facade of discipline remained, but his eyes betrayed sheer terror. Then Merino heard it, almost imperceptible over the howling Antarctic winds, the clack-clacking of chattering teeth. Covián slapped the soldier across the face, and then spoke with malice: \"On the battlefield the first step to control over a situation is power over your own body. You will get this back when you've shown you're more than a chattering imbecile.\" Covián ripped off the man's insignia and motioned to two of the marine's fellows. \"Throw him in the icebox until he learns a morsel of self-control.\" While García was dragged away his commanding officer First Lieutenant Pablo Wunderlich stepped forward \"Sir, I request I share the fate of First Sailor García, his failing is mine.\" Covián cocked an eyebrow, but nodded. Wunderlich turned on a dime and marched his way to the frigid oubliette.\n\nMerino placed a hand on Covián's jacket.\"A moment of your time, please.\" Stepping away from the crowd. Merino spoke softly to his instructor: \"I will have to fly to Arturo Prat for a Christmas dinner with Guzmán and his pencil necks, so you will be in command in my absence.

As I said, we could get something out of this.\"\n\nGuzmán turned to the open sea, which ran along the rocky edge of Greenwich Island. Iceflows littered the coast around the arched peaks and the steep snowy hills. \"The whalers have been active in this area for a long time, but the industry will be all the more lucrative if we encourage and support it.\"\n\n\"And you think we can get a cut of the pie,\" Guzmán said plainly. Nodding, Jaksic continued. \"We get a cut of the profits from their operations within the territory, and that ought to help alleviate our budget issue. It would also be a second wind for the economy of the southern provinces.\" Snow petrels and Antarctic pigeons flew in small clusters from the mountains behind them. White wings stood out like gliding stars below the red and orange glowing from bands of clouds. \"A lot of things would change if we let them run wild down here.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Guzmán replied, \"a lot of things would change for the whales. The ones that are still alive so far, at least.\" Closing his eyes, Guzmán fell quiet. He listened to the waves hitting the shore and the calls of the birds above. Sharp, fresh air swept past him, carrying the smells, both salty and pungent, of the sea. He didn't want any of it spoiled in the name of profit. But in the name of survival?\n\n\"Alright, we'll do it. It's the only way.\" Jaksic's shoulders softened, like a great weight had been lifted. He and Guzmán stared ahead, and for once in all the time they'd spent in the bay, paid attention to the birds which descended on the purple cliffs. Their nesting ground surrounded by deep, infinite blue."

He recalled vividly the endless hours of talking with Miranda, about how Peru could be made to cave to Chile's demands, and with Villarroel on how to best plan a diplomatic approach for Haiti. The painful nights spent devising a strategy that would isolate Argentina. But alas, work for the year was over, and regardless of Arturo Prat Base's sorry state, regardless of the incessant bickering over resources and strategy, it was time to rejoice around some hot Asado, forget the precarious situation of Chile in Antarctica, and prepare for the coming year. He entered the meeting room to see the whole command staff was already there, gathered to celebrate Christmas: Jaksic, Miranda, Villarroel, and even Merino, who must have been persuaded by someone to partake in the festivities. They were all talking loudly, smiling, and a sense of comradeship was floating in the air. The sweet aroma of Asado made Guzmán's mouth water as he sat beside Jaksic.\n\n\"I believe you don't understand, Enrique. With these factories, we could develop our territory easily, have settlers live on some islands... If we show the world our side of Antarctica is better managed than the Argentines', do you think they'll side with them? And with the revenue from the industry, we'll invest in more infrastructure, better defenses, and new equipment. It can only be beneficial.\"\n\nGuzmán sipped his drink while thinking about the point Jaksic was making. With more investments, the situation would improve for sure: replacing the outdated radios and buildings was an utmost priority, even more so than training new soldiers. Rumour was that Merino had recruited a new instruction officer, and Guzmán wondered how he could be kept out of such matters as the recruitment of personnel. It was time, he reflected, that he reassert his lead and take the initiative in the year to come. Reshaping the structure of command to keep the military under his thumb was vital. Having served himself a generous plate, Guzmán got up, his glass in hand, and cleared his throat to bring silence to the room. \"Excuse me, gentlemen. I would like to make a toast.\""

The summons gave no indication as to the purpose of the meeting, which told Miranda and Villarroel that it was both urgent and secret. Each man made his way to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with all due haste. They ran into each other in the lobby on their way up to Maschke's office. \"Think we're in trouble?\" Miranda asked with a smirk.\n\nVillarroel chuckled. \"If we were, they would've dispensed with the skulduggery.\"\n\nMaschke shook their hands when they stepped into his office. He was beaming. \"Thank you both for coming! Please, sit, sit. I had a most interesting meeting the other day with one Herman Phleger.\"\n\nMiranda cocked an eyebrow. \"I know the man from my ambassadorship in the United States. He's an honest man.\"\n\n\"I certainly got that impression from him. He came bearing a most fortuitous proposition. The OFN, via their Antarctic holdings, will come to our aid should the Argentines attempt to finish what they started, or the Japanese take advantage of our momentary weakness.\"\n\nMiranda and Villarroel exchanged an incredulous look. \"They proposed this out of the blue?\" Miranda asked.\n\n\"Will there be a public declaration of support?\" asked Villarroel. \"A treaty of any kind?\"\n\n\"For the moment, this arrangement is purely an informal one, and necessitates the highest degree of secrecy as I'm sure you agree. We have Phleger's word and a promise of OFN naval patrols to keep everyone honest. And that's good enough for the moment.\""

They ordered the strongest espresso on the menu and found a secluded table on the patio next to the street.\n\nVillarroel studied the pensive look on Miranda's face. \"Do you trust Mr. Phleger?\"\n\n\"From what I know of the man,\" said Miranda, taking a sip of espresso, \"his word is his bond. I fear I can't say the same for the institutions he represents. The United States let us down once before: they backed our claims, but when push came to shove and Argentina attacked us, they did nothing but consolidate their own slice of Antarctica.\"\n\n\"I was just thinking the same. If Washington had stood firm then, we might not be in our current predicament.\"\n\n\"We'll go mad thinking of what could have been. It seems sometimes like the whole world is a train that's on the wrong track.\" Miranda crossed his arms and looked into the distance. \"The OFN were always going to oppose Japanese encroachment. Their guarantees of support against the Argentines is enticing...\"\n\n\"But they've given no public declaration of support,\" Villarroel finished. \"I find that very telling. It's as if they want to wait and see which way the wind is blowing.\"\n\nMiranda shook his head, as if to clear it. \"Functionally, this 'promise' means nothing to our diplomatic negotiations. Its secret nature means we can't use it to pressure anyone, and if we have to fall back on OFN military, we've failed in our duties regardless.\"\n\nVillarroel nodded. \"So, on to the Caribbean then?\""

In his hand was a glass he sipped upon as he contemplated his situation. Another year had gone by. It had been a difficult one.\n\nThe icy winds wore down buildings, machines, and resolve like they did every year. Internal neglect, corruption, and politics worked to undermine their efforts here, as they do every year. The Argentinans grew bolder and more threatening, as they do every year.\n\nBut of course, the only thing stronger than internal politics, Argentina's military, and Mother Nature herself was Professor Guzmán's stubbornness. He was determined that if this place were to fall... once every last plank was broken away, or once the Argentine foe sat in Guzmán's office... his spirit would still remain somewhere in the rocks and ice that this place was built upon as his last defiance to the injustice and lawlessness of this world.\n\n\"Why am I so goddamn cynical?\" he asked under his breath. He reassured himself that this last was just a fluke. Jaksic's efforts in arranging a whaling presence could be the big break they were looking for. Not to mention the ceaseless efforts of Miranda and Villarroel to secure international support. It was difficult, yes, but last year was last year. Surely, this year will be better."

It didn't help that he was still trying to hold down a handful of brandies from his flight back and a hangover from Guzmán and his socialist sycophant's Christmas dinner. A waste of time and money that had left Merino wasted himself, attempting to sit through hours of masturbatory monologues from the cretinous comunachos that surrounded Guzmán.\n\nHis vision blurred as he took each step down the ladder with deliberate, conscious effort. Before finally crunching his boots into the temporarily snow-free ground. Fortunately, only Covián was there to see this embarrassment, and his face betrayed no judgment or humor, or at least he couldn't notice any through the haze.\n\n\"Welcome back to base, captain. Did you have a pleasant Christmas?\n\n\"Cut the crap soldier, the enemy doesn't take holidays and neither should we.\"\n\nA sly smile cut across Covián's face. \"A shame, sir, I had prepared a belated gift for you- good news for once. My most recent assessments indicate that the marines will very soon be ready for an operation into Argentine territory. I have called a meeting with Corvette Captain Wunderlich and his officers to discuss preliminary strategy at fourteen hundred hours... if you feel well enough to join, of course.\" A sudden rush of energy filled Merino, and his eyes began to adjust to the light of the vast wasteland lying before him.\n\n\"Of course I will be able to attend. Perhaps this Christmas wasn't a total waste after all, but, Covián just a word before you are dismissed.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain.\"\n\nMerino almost snarled as he spoke. \"\"Never call O'Higgins Land Argentine in my presence again...\""

Though he spent a lot of time in Chile, he was rarely able to truly go home. With his leave spent in Punta Arenas, tackling bureaucracy on the homefront, and fighting for his budget.\n\nHe sat on his old familiar sofa, the one he took for granted working at the university. Where his commute was 30 minutes instead of 3000 kilometers. His children, looking taller than when he had seen them last, eagerly showed him their new toys. The world felt a lot smaller years ago when driving to Santiago once felt like a trip.\n\nThe rain was incessant as day gave way to night. He tucked his children into bed for the first time in months. Then, with quiet reigning in the household, he made his way to the kitchen. Things were the way he remembered, enough so that he could put on the kettle and brew tea for two. However, much had changed, too. Family pictures of old now sat alongside new memories made without him. He sighed, finally facing the reality he had eluded since his homecoming.\n\nHis work was important, but even if it was for the better, life had gone on without him. This was the sacrifice he was making to secure the safety of his country and, as a consequence, his family. Guzmán's thoughts were interrupted by the whistling kettle atop. Upon finishing his task, he carefully brought the two cups of tea to the living room.\n\nThey sat on the couch, listening to the rainfall, all while his wife caught him up on all that he missed during his time away."

Endless hours had been spent poring over reports and maps trying to plan Captain Merino's sweeping offensive operation in between his spirited rants about the degeneracy of their Argentine enemy.\n\nThe strain of the situation was getting to the staff; even the usually unmovable Covián seemed to be showing signs of irritation and exhaustion, dark bagged eyes hanging over his normally impeccable poker face. Wunderlich let out an involuntary yawn, to his immediate regret.\n\n\"What was that, First Lieutenant\"? Captain Merino snapped. \"Is the defense of your country against fascist foreigners getting in the way of your beauty sleep or was that noise a failed attempt at human speech? Do you have something to add to this discussion\"? Scrambling for a response, Wunderlich began to speak perhaps more bluntly than he would normally address Merino\n\n\"Well with all due respect Captain, I think your plans are a waste of men and resources, a large prepared conventional offensive into the Argen... I mean, temporarily occupied O'Higgins Land would likely stall and be pushed back by the elements and our foes alike. We should be taking advantage of the mobility our snowcats afford us and the sporadic thinness of the enemy defenses to strike at weak targets in the interior and get proper intel on their patrols before we do anything of the scale some here have been proposing.\"\n\nMerino looked like he wanted to unleash another torrent of insults before his face abruptly softened, and he let out a yawn of his own. Hastily, trying to redirect attention, Merino slammed his personal binder shut. You make several good points, Corvette Captain, but it may be best to continue these preparations in the morning\"."

He turned to the other side and found the crowd spread in that direction too. Crowds in Arturo Prat? Jaksic thought he'd never see the day.\n\nHe checked off items in a clipboard as he approached the makeshift table. Foundations. Check. Structural framing. Check. There lay strewn sketches and plans for Arturo Prat's new whaling outpost. And the crowd marched down to turn those plans from papers on the table to reality on the coast. Base personnel hauled tools and building material together with whalers fresh from the sea. Arturo Prat's modest yet serviceable squad of snowcats brought further supplies over the hill. Jaksic dragged his boots on the ice, slipped the clipboard into his jacket, and walked alongside them.\n\nWalls were being raised from the snow and onto iron frames. Even a couple of army men had left the outposts they usually stayed burrowed in to help. Jaksic nodded at them as he stepped into one of the more complete buildings. The ceiling was still partly unfinished, a hole of exposed metal beams yawning into the sky. Steel roofing was being fastened every minute. Check. His shoulders slacked. They were ahead of schedule by a long shot. Some of the meat hooks had even been installed already. Check. If they sped things up a bit more, they might catch the last whales of the season.\n\nA whiff of metallic stench, and Jaksic could imagine a whale hanging limp from the ceiling. He was shaken by the sound of cleavers slicing pulping flesh, and the red washing over his clothes. It was just a memory, but it would repeat here over and over again. The sooner they finished building, the sooner it'd start. Whale after whale. One after another cut to pieces, thanks to his good management.\n\n\"...There's no going back on it now.\" He moved on to inspect the rest of the facility."

He took a sip of it as he watched his men go about their business.\n\nThe whaling facilities were a sight to behold. They seemed out of place on this base. In contrast to the dilapidated older buildings, the whaling infrastructure was new and had a sort of shine to it. It was like seeing a skyscraper in a village of straw huts or log cabins.\n\nHe allowed a smile to form on his face. There was a certain joy in watching progress be made before his eyes. He suspected it was similar to the pleasure one felt watching an ant farm. A grand, Antarctic ant farm.\n\nIn the corner of his eye, he noticed a crane start to turn a little too wide, smacking into the old domicile next to it. Guzmán jumped up and then walked towards the building to inspect the damage. Before he could reach it, the rooftop collapsed. He then started to run to make sure that nobody was hurt. It didn't take him long to realize that, by some miracle, the building was empty when it collapsed.\n\n\"Thank God'' he said, catching his breath. He had gotten lucky; nobody was hurt, but he was not lucky enough to have this domicile not be destroyed. Right before winter, at that. He sighed and determined he'd need to replace it come the end of winter. But he had to think of what to do in the meantime..."

 antarctica_aac_main.35.desc: "Through the snow, like phantoms, First Lieutenant Wunderlich, First Sailor García, and two other marines stalked away from the remains of their prey: an isolated Argentine supply dump deep in occupied territory. Their skis afforded them excellent mobility as they slid across the white plains with a certain odd grace. Theirs was a mission of infiltration and reconnaissance behind enemy lines, with one small detour.\n\nThis small depot was a sort of redoubt for the nearby Argentine bases, a place to retreat to in case they were overrun or cut off. At least, that's how it would work in theory. After the Marines were done, it was worse than useless. Looting the place for supplies was always part of the plan, but it was Wunderlich's idea to rig the area with landmines and booby traps, sabotaging future retreats.\n\nIt was hardly surprising to see a lack of guards at such a remote outpost, but the absence of any sort of military presence for miles was either a sign of incompetence or weakness, both of which bode well for the Captain's plans. While Wunderlich may dislike the man, he could hardly doubt Merino's vision. Until now, Antarctic warfare had consisted of defending a series of static fortifications inland with the majority of the fighting taking place on the coast, leaving the land defenses untouched, secure in the belief that their surroundings were too dangerous to be crossed. Merino sought to take advantage of these dangers, crossing the icy wastes and striking their enemy where they expected it least. Small camouflaged units could move almost invisibly, easily breaching long, sparsely manned lines.\n\nThe true enemy was not the Argentinians, however, but trench foot, hypothermia, and frostbite. Their training, combined with rudimentary but effective winter gear, had rendered these difficulties surmountable if still dangerous. They would soon arrive at their buried snowcat raider and begin the return to base. Their mission was close to success."

Arturo Prat's whaling facilities had been finished quickly enough that they'd managed to scrounge a profit from the season's end. Now, daylight was ebbing away, shortening one hour at a time. The last ships were coming in.\n\nJaksic watched the body of another whale hauled under the blaring lights. How many had undergone the same nightly procession, he did not know. They ought to be in his records, the exact numbers, but Jaksic preferred not to check. He still came out to observe, sometimes closer or farther, trying to identify the species. It'd been easier ever since he'd gotten a chart. Blue whales were, of course, recognizable by their size and rarity. But there were others: humpbacks, fin whales, right whales, sei. Over time, the differences and peculiarities of each type became less of a vague descriptor in a textbook and more something he could see at first glance. Even if he never saw these peculiarities in life.\n\nProcessions in the whaling industry are short and without pomp, though. It became impossible to identify a species the moment revving saw blades struck the skin. What made each whale distinct was washed away in explosions of blood. A humpback and a sei looked the exact same when cut into frozen chunks of meat or melted and poured in barrels of tran.\n\nJaksic did not supervise this part of the process. He walked briskly past the coast of scattered skulls and rib cages the whalers left behind and retreated back into the tiny cubicle, the office where the whales were only numbers on a page. There, the budgetary balance books showed him profits and projections. If they allowed another season's worth of whaling next summer, they might just be in the clear by the end of the year. Let the whalers return one more time, and the budget issues will be resolved. One more season of littered bones and squelching meat."

They had no doubt known about the influx of cash that Carlos Jaksic's ideas created, and the army wanted their chance to 'wow' Guzmán into kicking some funds in their direction.\n\nGuzmán nodded, and the attaché continued. \"Well, what if I told you this island could become a vital part of Arturo Prat Base's defensive perimeter.\"\n\nThe attaché gestured for Guzmán and his cadre to step into a tent. Inside were two concept sketches and sleeping surveyors. \"Gentlemen, may I introduce the two potential fortification plans for Ongley Island. An early warning station, or, if the budget has room for it, a fortified rock that can stave off the Argentineans for days.\"\n\nAfter mulling it over with his subordinates over the phone, Guzmán reached his conclusion."

The ringing of feet on the metal stairs no doubt foretold more good news for their planned offensive. A few months ago, the world had seemed to stand in the Captain's way, from the red bureaucrats to the rat-faced politicians; even the very weather had conspired to break his resolve. But Merino was unlike the insects that infected Chile; in his tiny fief, he had sculpted this shard of the nation's soul into something worthy of his respect. The marines arrayed below him betrayed none of the stains of degeneracy of their countrymen; they had risen above the spoiled, rotten creatures that had spawned them. Under Covián's tutelage, men like the newly promoted Corvette Captain Wunderlich had finally cast aside his scruples and embraced the killer within. The sorties had proceeded at pace, proving the captain's theories that the weakness of the Argentine \"culture\" matched that of their defenses. Soon Merino's final victory would be at hand.\n\nIn an instant, a single piece of paper brought it all back to earth. The communiqué from that sniveling rodent of a secretary bore the gravest of news. While the men at base had been cleansed of the rot, their motherland's tumors had proven terminal. Across the countryside, the peasantry, the heart of the Chilean nation, had been turned. Now, humble farmers had metamorphized into a plague of voracious locusts, burning and looting through the south, hypnotized by the seductive dance of their demonic red masters. The limp-wristed tea sippers in Santiago were on their knees, slathering his boots in their rancid saliva in their call for help. For a moment, Merino considered leaving them to their fate, but the Captain knew his duty, after all Covián could handle any unforeseen Argentine mischief. In the thick of winter, returning by boat would be impossible; only Jaksic and his goons could possibly airlift him and his men home, but rest assured he would return.

Whaling season had brought profits unseen since he'd first taken up work in Antarctica, and though Jaksic knew all too much of the flesh the numbers were carved of, it did not negate the results.\n\nEventually he stood and stretched, hazily pulling his coat over his shoulders. A broadcast from the neighboring office blurred in wavering radio static. Jaksic took his umbrella and hat, thinking of what Emilia and the kids would say when he got home so late. They were always anxious to see as much of him before he went south again.\n\nHis phone rang startlingly loud against the quiet. Jaksic frowned. So late, at a slow time of year?\n\nThen, down the hall, the ringing was repeated. Two doors down, a third phone came alive. Then a fourth, all the way across the building. Jaksic held the receiver up to his ear, but none of the words quite registered. Instead, he heard the music next door fade into static, and solemn words replace it.\n\n\"We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special news bulletin: the unrest in Cautín province is rapidly spreading.\"\n\nHe'd hung up shortly and went home even quicker. His family complained the next morning when he left early, but his mind was on larger yet intimate events. Southern Chile was in flames. The people he'd grown side by side with, the poor peasants who held the haciendas on their bruised backs, had reached their limit. He had seen the way life spun here, some drinking deep and greedy and most sinking in painfully familiar misery. Despite what he hoped, the misery wouldn't end here, it would only intensify when the protests were suppressed.\n\nThe call had given him his task.

It had been a chaotic morning.\n\nHe met with police officers who assured that the local situation in Tierra del Fuego was under control one hour, and heard landowners rant about how the local peasant powderkeg was ready to explode the next. He'd heard the trepidation inside the Punta Arenas townhall and the lively discussions from fellow members of the Socialist Party about what this crisis meant for the future. In his mind, the future was filled with darkness. The inevitability he was contributing was in the shadow of each plane. \"What do you make of all this waste?\" said the man behind him.

Sneaking a glance to the banister above, the marine could see Captain Merino simply staring into the distance, his eyes ignoring the movements of his subordinates, instead fixed on the foggy horizon.\n\nThe Captain dedicated much time to such solitary brooding since they had left the Navy's headquarters in Valparaíso, taking command of the wintered-in ship and beginning the journey to pacify the growing insurrection.\n\nBut the Captain did not look like a man preparing to disperse a peasant revolt. No, his demeanor reminded Wunderlich of Baroque painting, a great conqueror surveying his domain. Indeed, the Captain had explained his campaign as if he were Napoleon in the days before Austerlitz, going into granular detail of his elaborate strategy to defeat the rustic legions. They were to set up base in the small port of Carahue in the Cautín province. They would then link up with the rest of their forces, including Wunderlich's marines. Merino would lead them inland, disposing of enemy grain silos, rickety fortifications, and angry peasants in detail.\n\nNo doubt, the Captain saw this as his Gaul, where he would achieve the fame and glory needed for his next grasp at power. Of course, Wunderlich didn't much care about the politics of it all, nor he was he much bothered by their opposition. Wunderlich was not just a marine, he was a weapon honed in the most inhospitable place on earth.\n\nIf anything, he felt a sense of relief that they would be facing inbred farmers rather than Argentine artillery, only adding to his calm optimism.

This was the site of innumerable historic frontier wars with native Mapuches, but the region felt anything but pacified. The recent flood of reserve security forces had done little to change that, and the insurrection was spreading faster every day. Wunderlich somehow doubted that even if they shot every communist, these lands would ever be truly tame.\n\nThis patrol was eerily quiet, with not even a potshot from a drunk farmer, and night was fast approaching. Suddenly, barely visible in the red of the setting sun was a figure hunched behind a leafless bush. Typical of communist naivete, the rebels had decided to start their insurrection on May Day in the heart of winter, leaving the normally lush forest barren. Wunderlich motioned to move into cover and took the shot, sending the red sprawling into the dirt.\n\nThen, without warning, the automatic rifles lit up the twilight. The guerillas unleashed a barrage of dragon fire into the dark, but for all their firepower, they did naught but reveal their positions. When their clips were depleted, they were left helpless, their positions overrun with mechanical precision.\n\nIn a few moments, it was all over.

The Antarctic marines had cut their teeth in the abyss of Earth's frozen Tartarus, they had not just tamed the night, they had conquered it.\n\nWunderlich rubbed his boot in the sand three times, signaling his men to spring the trap. Suddenly, the darkness lit up with the light of machine gun fire. The marines made up for a lack of visibility with the sheer density of tracer ammunition. Soon, the sound of the guns was accompanied by the splintering of wood and the squealing of men. There was no time for the rebels to fire back; they could either brave the rapids or simply crumble beneath the barrage.\n\nWunderlich signaled his men to hold fire. Shining a flashlight to the waters below, he saw the remains of one of the insurgent boats.\n\nInside was not a hardened collection of communist fighters but a few youths with boxes of produce from the local farms and only a rusty machete for protection.\n\nWunderlich's disgust with the rebels only mounted. To recruit their own children into this hopeless cause was reprehensible. Despite everything, he felt little regret at the slaughter before him, remembering the teachings of Covián."

 antarctica_aac_main.45.desc: "The situation had escalated. When Corvette Captain Wunderlich had pursued the insurgents to the nearby Hacienda, he had suspected they intended to burn the place to the ground in order to deny his men a night's rest. The reality was much worse. Arriving at the sprawling plantation complex, they were not greeted with burning embers, but a fully intact fortress, and many more insurgents.\n\nThe rebels had spread themselves too thin trying to defend the entire complex, allowing the marines to terminate their positions in isolated houses and barns. It didn't take long for them to catch onto their mistake. The ringing of a large bell in the plantation's center alerted the residents to flee, swarming out of the houses like rats in a flood. Moving back to the fortress of a mansion, followed in tow by unarmed native workers. Pursuing the rebels was easy enough, but now the room-to-room fighting had stalled all progress.\n\nWunderlich ducked behind a table in the opulent dining hall where he just a week prior had feasted with the old, now likely dead, Hacendado, reaping the consequences of decades of brutal treatment towards his Mapuche workers. The cacophony of gunfire and squeals of pain from the other rooms were stymieing Wunderlich's attempt to regain composure. They were supposed to be the last defense of Chilean civilization, but at this rate, some up jumped savages would do the Argentines' job for them.. Picking up the walkie-talkie, Wunderlich ordered a full evacuation from the house. Leading the withdrawal, Wunderlich ducked beneath the gunfire, a splinter of whitewashed wood embedding itself in his cheek.\n\nRegrouping behind a capsized tractor, one of his men began yelling, protesting the retreat, bloody spittle flying out his mouth. Wunderlich noticed the shine of a dogtag in his clutches. With one almost breathless phrase, the Corvette Captain silenced his men. \"We... are...not... retreating.\" Then he gave the order."

No matter how many shadowy movements he noticed in the woods or creaking steps he heard in the old barn, there was nothing lurking in the darkness. No, the real horrors were the cruel haciendado and the pang of hunger in their bellies, but their people had held firm against these challenges for generations and would do so for many more. Monsters did not exist, and they were not coming to get you, his parents assured him time and again.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nCrouching in the small cabin on the edge of the forest, Quidel and his father, could hear the whispering or clicking growing closer every second. They had been on the run for several days now, since the creatures had emerged from the woods, leaving the farm they had lived in for generations a smoldering ruin. The things had followed them north to another sanctuary, where they found new victims. The wet, gurgling screams Quidel heard as they slipped away implied a fate far worse than death.\n\nThe next morning, dysentery claimed his mother, perhaps a mercy to at least avoid falling into their claws. Rumors had spread of simple farmers dragged off to their ship where unspeakable horrors were exacted upon them in its lightless bowels.\n\nAs the noises drew closer, his father drew out of his muddy trousers a small revolver. \"They won't be able to hurt us anymore,\" he murmured, stroking Quidel's head and raising the gun. Then, in the window, Quidel saw it, a pale face looking down at them, a silhouette hiding its impossibly wide grin of a thousand sharpened teeth slobbering to gobble up another victim."

There were low noises, half-toned growls coming from the radio, and, sometimes, a series of high-pitched rhythmic sounds indicating another radio user somewhere else. The hope of contacting Adelaide Island was still motivating the professor, though he now had the creeping feeling that there could be no one left at the outpost to answer. The first failures to contact the garrison hadn't really bothered anyone, if he recalled correctly: what can we expect of a team with equipment that's been obsolete for twenty years? had interjected an officer when Guzmán had first voiced his concerns. He wasn't entirely wrong, either. Such incidents had already happened in the past, and winter wasn't helping much.\n\nStaring through the window, the professor could not help but shudder at the sight of the deep fog and snow falling, and he knew that, if something had happened to the men on Adelaide Island, there would be no way to help them. Winter cut off the island from the rest of the Chileans in Antarctica, and with all mobile assets redeployed to the mainland at the moment, it was impossible to attempt a rescue mission if one was foolish enough to defy the natural elements.\n\nBut there was no one foolish enough to try and reach Adelaide Island in this period of the year, Guzmán repeated to himself grimly. Still, the situation was becoming worrying. If at least a plane could do a flyover, or a ship get close enough to send an investigation party... Maybe those fears were exaggerated, but Guzmán did not want to take any chances.\n\nGlumly, he concluded that only Merino would be able to drag around the resources to mount such a party. He needed his help, however much he'd have preferred to avoid it. Reaching to the radio, the professor altered the parameters and adjusted them to Merino's personal frequency. He would probably regret it..."

 antarctica_aac_main.48.desc: "The Captain walked down the stairs, his boots echoing the sound of clanking metal with each step. A silence hung in the air that gave Merino a sense of vague unease, there was a certain comfort he derived from the normal hustle and bustle of a ship and her crew. He had commanded the Captain Prat for years now, it was this ship that had braved the Argentine scourge in the Snipe War. She was his personal instrument of vengeance and conquest, to see her reduced to policing traitors. Perhaps it was fitting; just like her commander, she was left cleaning up the bile-laden vomit of her bloated and sick nation. Merino reminded himself, as he did so many times, that this state of affairs was only temporary.\n\nAfter reaching his destination deep in the Captain Prat's bowels, the Captain tugged at the rusty hatch, cringing at its screeching metallic whine. Before his eyes could register the environment, he was met with the familiar smell of human discharge blowing into his nostrils on a dank, stale cloud. A single blinking light illuminated the room. In the center of the room, standing above a small and twisted metal chair, was the handsome face of the ship's cook. \"We have a new catch, Captain. I suspect this fish will be far more tender than our last meal.\"\n\nMerino raised his hand to silence the man. \"Just extract what limited intelligence is in the heads of these primates, so we can finally be rid of this place. If you don't find out what mud pit their friends are wallowing in soon... well, I am sure the electrician could be up to the task.\" The cook nodded, directing Merino's gaze to the pathetic creature huddled in the corner. It resembled a crude parody of a child, shivering in its filth. The Captain's lip curled with revulsion, to think these lowly things could bring his once great nation to its knees. Indeed, if he didn't act soon..."

The little establishment had naturally been cleared of any riffraff, so the Captain had the patio to himself, content to observe the boulevard as he sipped his complementary 1939 Sherry. The whole town was a wreck, to be sure; the Valdivia Earthquake had destroyed what little infrastructure these rustics had been able to put together, and the insurrection had trampled the rest. Nonetheless, the Captain basked in the sheer quiet calm of the place. Where once hordes of tramps and vagabonds scuttled about now, only a few shop-goers hurried about their daily business, avoiding the eyes of their betters. The marines had assisted in bringing a serenity unseen in the region since perhaps before the first savages had seen fit to build their mud huts in the shadows of the Andes. He closed his eyes, leaning back and basking in the afternoon sun....\n\nOnly to suddenly be torn from his reverie by the put-putting of an old engine and a screeching whine. Merino snapped to attention, instinctively reaching for his sidearm before realizing who was approaching. In a rusted, smoking old thing that could charitably be called a car sat Corvette Captain Wunderlich. \"What the devil are you doing in that thing officer\" screamed Merino with half the mind to shoot the marine on the spot.\n\n\"Apologies for the interruption Captain, but there is urgent news from Arturo Prat Base. They lost contact with Adelaide Island. Professor Guzmán has ordered your immediate return.\" The Captain's lip curled as his mind raced through possibilities: a communist mutiny, Argentine invasion, or perhaps those brain-dead Neanderthals in the garrison had confused their radio receiver for an extra dinner ration. All likely possibilities."

It was not the headline that turned his stomach, or the contents of the corresponding article. It was what was absent.\n\nThat which was missing from airways and printed media and traveled by word of mouth. Word of the revelry of violence that the army had unleashed in Cautín. Names of vanished Mapuche settlements. Smuggled pictures of graves and lined up corpses of people Jaksic had taken up public service to protect. All he'd done was send the soldiers to them, loaded the guns for the executioners and...\n\nThe gust of wind that blew past his face did not bring comfort, but it at least brought him to the present. A pale blue colored the twilight skies above Arturo Prat, darkening in the hazy fog from where the shadows of buildings arose along the coast. The newly minted radio tower reflected blinking red lights into the waters, opposite from where he observed.\n\nIt was just one of the many components added to the expanding whaling facilities. Word of the atrocities surrounding the Cautinazo spread quick, but no rumors made their way across Chile's ports faster than those about the rising new industry in Antarctica. \"For once,\" Guzmán had told Jaksic, \"they're talking about us.\"\n\nEconomically, there was only one right answer: More facilities, more bases and storage space. Why not turn a temporary solution into a permanent arrangement if the profits speak for themselves? Is it even a choice if so many demand for it? More ships, more whalers, more attention in the press, more money. More knives awash with salty blood.\n\nBeams of light broke through the mist. Jaksic winced as the blaring white passed over him. His legs gave in, and he sat on one of the rocks along the bay as the ship lights danced over the ice flows and rolling hills. This season's whalers had arrived, and they were so hungry."

As Adelaide Island slowly revealed itself in the dark mist of the early morning, its pristine beauty clashed with the phantom wails carried on the wind. Contact had been lost with the remote outpost sometime in the last few weeks.\n\nNaturally, Guzmán had neither the guts nor wits to order an expedition himself, instead waiting for Merino to finish the pest control back home. A whole outpost up and disappearing under that weasel's nose was so fitting Merino almost laughed when he heard the news. That humor had dried up quickly, replaced with a potent but helpless rage.\n\nThe coming of Spring had made the journey through the ice feasible, but only just. It was still rife with danger. They had moved slowly, far slower than the Captain would have preferred. The Captain Prat slid along the black water with the tepid sluggishness of a scared child creeping through a dark hallway, the icebergs like ghosts staring up at them. The outpost would have certainly spotted them by now, but there was nothing, no boats, no flares, no radio signals.\n\nTaking out his pair of binoculars Merino gazed onto the shore, he could almost see the silhouettes of the buildings and fortifications, but they emitted no light. Either the inhabitants were long dead, or whoever was left did not want to be seen. They were in for a rude awakening, no one escaped his predatory gaze. He would find whoever did this and then... well, he would put some of the lessons from the Cautín to use.\n\nAs Merino lowered the binoculars, he noticed Wunderlich waiting patiently behind him. \"The tender boat is almost ready, sir, we can send a scouting party ashore at your command.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary. Corvette Captain\" Merino said looking once more at the Island before him, his voice barely audible over the howls, \"I will be surveying the outpost.\""

The sense of eerie emptiness was only magnified up close, even for the antarctic base, there was deathly quiet in the air. The beaches appeared empty at first glance, not particularly odd at the tail end of winter.\n\nAs Merino looked up he noticed that even through the thick mist, he could see the central habitat had been burnt to a crisp, a gaping hole in the wall barely visible. Not too unexpected, the dryness of this frozen desert made fire a constant hazard; he wouldn't put it past the civilian residents to cause some sort of accident. But Merino had personally ordered a contingent of crack troops and a stringent plan of inspections and drills. It was odd to think his own men would be so incompetent.\n\nWalking along the shore as his marine escort fanned out, he noticed the lack of any sort of defensive measures. he had ordered the emplacement of naval guns and anti-air batteries months earlier, not to mention a network of trenches. Given the incompetence of the Antarctic administration outside his direct command, he couldn't rule out simple negligence, it wouldn't be below these worms to cower in their huts rather than listen to a direct order. Still, he would've expected at least some effort put into token effort put into defense rather than its complete absence.\n\nLooking up into the distance, Merino noticed the base's radio tower, a metal sentinel watching over the island. Perhaps they had tried to get a message through the winter storms, a foolish idea given the weather, but the base was not lacking for fools. Then again, perhaps the vast interior still held some secrets, though it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. And of course there was always the ocean, the waves suck up all that enters them, but every now then one gets lucky. The marines looked on in anticipation, waiting for his orders.

Captain Merino stepped forth and delivered a direct kick. It crumbled upon contact.\n\n\"Forward, men.\" He signaled to the marines behind him, stepping through the pile of ash that had been the door. Above them was a cobweb of twisted metal and wood beams, the twilight cast through the gashes as flurries of snow blew in. The embers of fire still snaked through the charred walls.\n\nThe first body was in the corner. A crouching figure with torn skin covered in a tattered rag that once was a jacket. Its single arm reached out, nails clawing into the wall, with fat and muscle contracted and thin. Merino stared down at the first Chilean he had met on Adelaide Island. Clouds of ash surrounded the captain as he stumbled over mounds of blackened snow. Entangled arms and legs reached around him, piles of bodies all grasping desperately towards an exit. They were nearly indistinguishable from the soot marks on labyrinthian halls, except for the faint reddish marks of charred skin and pearly white teeth in gaping mouths. Each mangled head was counted. Most of the inhabitants of Adelaide Island died here, stumbling and crawling over each other in the dark as their lungs filled with smoke.\n\nMerino grit his teeth as his boot sank into something soft. There was a rip and a dull squelch. Everything below his ankle was draped in darkness, the ashen bones of a rib cage engaged his foot. Burnt flesh crunched as he dislodged himself out of the corpse's chest. The flashlights of the marines washed past Merino's pale face and into the wide common area ahead. More bodies piled together in the corners of the room. Some did not even have shabby remains of clothes. The fire had caught them asleep. Unprepared. Yet others bore less pronounced burns. They lay limp across the floor, or reposed against a wall, not like the twisted agony of those in the hall. Almost relaxed. Were they drunk? Had they accepted their fate?"

There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the only sounds he could hear were the sounds of his team's footsteps and the howling wind. In truth, he was happy to finally be back in Antarctica after having spent so much time away. Antarctica may be a barren wasteland, but compared to the chaos of the Cautín Rebellion, it was paradise. Besides, he had come to view this place as home. He missed the people he worked with, he missed the sights, he missed the work he was doing here.\n\nStill, these were less than ideal circumstances to return to. He had been sent to investigate the recent fire here and see what exactly became of the men here. Truth be told, he considered it a bit of a fool's errand. The island was huge, making a full search of the place impossible. Moreover, Wunderlich believed, it was impossible anyone could have survived a fire like that.\n\nHe was ready to call it off.

A radio building identical to any other across the territory... except for the missing tower.\n\nHe and a pair of marines circled the building, rifles drawn. They kicked around mounds of snow, lanterns sweeping the area. Not only was the mast missing, there wasn't a single shard of metal or strand of wire. Merino's gaze met his men's. Radio masts had risen all over Antarctica since Byrd first stepped onto the ice, linking adrift bases through airwave chains. None of the modern ventures into the last frontier would be possible without radio.\n\nSo why did Adelaide's crew sever their own ears? The first word in Merino's mind was insanity. Only the insane would clip their own tongue. He looked at the horizon, twilight receding into faint glimmers along the icy waves. Only Antarctica's darkness, its expanse, its mantle of isolation, could make one want to pluck out his eyes.\n\nA good push unhinged the door. A Communist infiltrator? Or an Argentine saboteur? Both? Merino scoffed as they stepped into the charred hall. Neither would be competent enough. Perhaps the crew's minds were rotten by suicidal, Bolshevist fantasies? He promised himself he'd find the truth, entering the communication's room. A chair, flipped over, for a radio operator long dead. Table broken in half, blackened transmitters and receivers fallen in a pile, exposed wire spilling out like tangled entrails. One truth already sat before Merino."

Besides, the men could always use some more harsh weather field training.\n\nStanding atop a patch of high ground, he gazed out into the sea; he could almost imagine the Argentines lurking in the nearby waters, mocking him with its very presence. This place could've been a fortress if his plans had been followed. This spot would've made for a perfect vantage point for a naval gun, with a clear view of approaching ships.\n\nThe fools, how could they have missed something so obvious, something so...\n\nWith a crash, Merino slid down the hill, tumbling into a hole below, his aging joints battered by the harsh gravel. His fall was stopped by a crack of something against his goggles. A jagged piece of metal impaled itself a few millimeters from his iris.\n\nCarefully removing the now destroyed snow goggles, his eyes immediately felt the soreness of the cold air, but he could still easily make out the military grade steel shard embedded within them."

Though the differences were subtle between different degrees of freezing,to one so attuned to the Arctic as he, it was undeniable that summer was arriving.\n\nWhatever had occurred here was no accident; that had been clear to him since stepping foot on the island. Whoever had attempted this flimsy cover-up had grossly underestimated him, thinking Merino would be so stupid as to overlook the clear evidence of a full-scale military conflict from the unburnt corpses to the hastily filled-in trenches\n\nToo many who had crossed paths with Merino had made the same mistake and paid the price. Indeed, he was here partly out of that same dismissive flippancy, the higher-ups thinking they could exile Merino to the far south and let him freeze his way into an early retirement.\n\nOh how wrong they were. As Caesar campaigned in Gaul and Napoleon conquered Egypt, this would be the Captain's proving ground. He would conquer this continent, push Guzmán, the Argentines, and all the other subhuman communists into the sea.

Scattered remains of the ice platforms that surrounded the island during winter. If Merino had been on the island, he knew he would have stayed to fight. Others? He supposed they might have tried escaping through the ice. Still, no corpses. \"Here,\" Merino gestured into the abyss where the marines pointed their flashlights. Again nothing. But a marine on the other side, tugging at one of the nets, screamed. \"It's stuck!\"\n\nEvery man pulled much as he could. Merino shook and breathed warm steam through his hands, grip tightening as blood returned to his blue-tinged fingers. Out of the water slid a hand crooked into a unnatural angle. Discolored patches of red and purplish covered the victim's arms and legs, frozen into a fetal position. They struggled to unwrap the net, only to uncover a face too bloated to recognize.

His grandparents always said they had to walk to school uphill through the snow both ways barefoot.

He had never been more grateful for the mountaineering training he got from Covián when he was with the Marines.\n\nHe'd finally gotten up the hill when he saw the trail leading to a figure, collapsed on its frontside. He quickly found himself running towards it, using his rifle to turn the frozen body over.\n\nThe dead man was an Argentine soldier with one or two bullet holes in his uniform-no doubt delivered by Chilean resistance. The bullets were covered by some improvised bandages-it seems the bullets didn't kill the guy, at least not right away. Wunderlich couldn't help but wonder why the man would wander further into the interior after being shot, though. Perhaps, Wunderlich pondered, he was abandoned?\n\nEither way, this was big news.

And certainly not him.\" He pointed at the Argentine patch.\n\nMerino's knuckles were white where he gripped the edge of the table. \"Argentines,\" he hissed, the word dripping with venom. \"Those vermin slaughtered our men like livestock.\"\n\nHe slammed a fist down, making the items jump. \"Attack, resistance, casualties... then the cover-up! Those cowards burned the evidence, defiled the dead!\" His gaze hardened. \"And Guzmán... that lily-livered paper-pusher back at Arturo Prat. He knew. Received fragmented reports, ignored warnings! He let those Argentine scum attack Chilean soil, murder Chilean men, and covered their tracks!\"\n\nThe accusation hung in the confined space, thick and poisonous. To Merino, it wasn't just incompetence; it was complicity, bordering on treason. The final, unforgivable insult after years of perceived mismanagement and disregard for the military's role.

Those malformed humanoids had struck again. Like the cowards they were had they bashed their heads against Chile's weakest link, Adelaide Island.\n\nAt least Merino could take comfort that the candy taken from this proverbial infant contained arsenic and razor blades. Clearly, those Platinean primates had underestimated the martial spirit of the Chilean defenders and were left too bloodied to garrison the island. It was in the ratlike Argentine nature to deceive, cheat, and lie when others would fight, why else had they attempted this charade? The Captain was used to dealing with such tactics and saw right through it.\n\nUnfortunately, rats came in swarms, and the Argentines clearly had friends in the Chilean base. Those Bolshevik degenerates had either known along or were too mentally feeble to predict the most simple of offensive actions. They would pay for their crimes, and if Merino had his way, they would end up drawn and quartered as well.\n\nSuddenly the napalm seemed to leave his chest, replaced by a brutal chill. This was the chance he had been waiting for. His mind immediately jumped to the plan. He had all he needed to arrest Jaksic, Guzmán, and all the rest, with the guns and men to make resistance impossible.\n\nOh yes, this would be wonderful. He imagined the smug grin of Guzmán's apelike face disappearing when he was introduced to all the Captain's wonderful new toys he had discovered in the Cautín. Merino reverted his expression to a cold professionalism then straightened his back, adjusted his collar..."

The entirety of Arturo Prat, from the wayward whalers to the electricians, huddled in the mess hall. Silence reigned as the briefing dragged on torturously. New Swabia had disintegrated faster than anyone could have predicted, casting thousands of people into the white abyss. The Germans and the OFN were exchanging fire and extending the frontline in Africa down to the end of the world. New flags were being planted on the continent.\n\nAs the spectre of war, hunger, and nuclear apocalypse loomed over their heads, the first question in everyone's minds, of course, was what the hell the Argentines would do. \"Nothing, for now,\" Guzmán assured. \"Not with a Brazilian armada on their backs.\"\n\nA uniformed sailor broke through the crowd. \"Professor, has Captain Merino been made aware of this?\"\n\n\"We... don't know.\" He rubbed cold sweat off his brow. \"Communications are down.\" A dozen more questions erupted in response. Would the Chilean Navy mobilize? How should Chile respond to Brazilian and Uruguayan claims? Could we share New Swabia's fate? At that moment, it seemed the whole world was prepared to spill blood over sheets of ice."

There was no question about it: Argentina had once again launched an attack against Adelaide Island and destroyed the base, alongside its inhabitants, in totality.\n\n\"The search isn't over,\" a uniformed aide said, \"but the chances of finding a survivor by now are...\"\n\nJaksic cleared his throat, smoke trailing as he turned towards Guzmán.\n\n\"This isn't like Leal,\" Guzmán muttered, and startled when all eyes became pinned on him. \"It just wouldn't make sense. Operation 90 took a lot of resources. He wouldn't have wasted any on such a wasteful attack.\"\n\n\"Sympathizing with the enemy, are we, Julio?\" Jaksic's smile faltered when Guzmán didn't return the jab. He hummed. \"Perhaps the attack was one hothead's idea, and Leal was unaware.\"\n\nGuzmán nodded, and knew Merino could do the same to them. \"Perhaps.\"\n\n Guzmán's stomach lurched, more dead Chileans under his watch, one failure after another.

Jaksic was the first to raise his voice.\n\n\"What matters to us is Nissui's misfortune. The conglomerate has used Japanese Antarctica as a playground since its establishment, and Chile's whaling industry has suffered from their encroachment in our waters.\"\n\n\"You're saying good riddance to a rival, then?\" Guzmán allowed the slightest smile.\n\n\"Precisely,\" Jaksic answered. \"Still, we should be cautious. There's no telling what Shōwa Station will do now. A crisis like this... it's unprecedented.\"\n\n\"Cornered dogs are quickest to bite,\" Guzmán concluded.

Never sure this time of year.\"\n\nThe two men checked their watches at the same time, smiling. It was still morning. Guzmán peered at the window, where charcoal black enveloped the land. He turned around and unceremoniously plopped down on a chair opposite Jaksic's, whose eyebrows pushed up into his forehead.\n\nOccasionally, one of Jaksic's neighbors would pass by and glance into the room. At first, they saw two colleagues sitting far apart, with serious expressions. An hour later, Guzmán surprised Jaksic again by slipping a bottle of whiskey out of his suitcase. Another hour and a couple too many shots after, they were now two friends hunched over the desk, laughing, comparing the worst insults they'd received from Captain Merino.\n\n\"He's a clown,\" Jaksic said breezily. Another shot downed.\n\nGuzmán chuckled. \"He's dangerous.\"\n\nTo that, they were both silent. Jaksic tugged at his collar, followed Guzmán, and drank another. \"My wife would be terribly angry with me right now, Julio,\" he said. \"Drinking so much. Destroying my liver. I'll have to apologize to her, if I return.\" Sitting there, awaiting Merino's entrance from the dark, they envied Villarroel and Miranda's travels.

In the kitchens they served steaming soup and in the looming whalers' processing plant men squelched knee-deep in saline blood.\n\nIt was more traffic than winter's usual, but these were unusual times. So they said in the barracks, where the sailors' idle chatter spread the news.\n\n\"Adelaide,\" Arturo Prat spoke. \"Adelaide is lost.\"\n\nTheir eyes turned towards the windows. Buzzing lights grasped vainly into the snow, and everything beyond their reach was black. Someone mused from atop his bunk that this must have been how it felt in Adelaide. \"Before the attack.\" The sailors looked into the dark and felt it was staring back, with iron eyes round like Argentine rifle barrels.\n\nSometimes, they'd swear they saw the glint of steel. Or found suspicious footprints on the snow. Reports of Argentine forces prowling the darkness arrived at Guzmán's desk on a near daily basis, and all went unconfirmed. Arturo Prat kept its eyes pinned on where light ended and the Antarctic night began, waiting for an attack that never came. \"It might come tomorrow,\" it said to itself, and kept watch.\n\nThere wasn't much else to do but wait, either for death or spring."

The rumors about Adelaide revolved in his head like the gusts of ice raised by winter wind.\n\nArturo Prat needed a capable leader, he thought. His fingers searched deep inside a little cabinet near the back of the room. They needed a leader with his head on straight. Someone who could stop another Adelaide, not a semi-feral ape like Merino. Guzmán laughed to himself. The Captain's lexis was rubbing off on him.\n\nOut of the cabinet appeared a letter, one he had closely concealed for months, a secret correspondence with Colonel Leal.\n\nEven though he barely knew the man outside of years of shadow diplomacy, Guzmán had developed some fondness for the Quixotic Argentine. News of Adelaide had tainted the feeling. He doubted it was Leal who had ordered the attack; no, it seemed they both had to contend with warmongering madmen plotting behind their backs. It only made these discussions more important. They'd been making progress hatching out a peace plan between the two sectors, discussing border changes and demilitarization.\n\nThat was until his penpals' expedition to the South Pole had begun, and the letters abruptly stopped. Guzmán would never stop pursuing peace, but with the affairs on the other side of the border so uncertain, it seemed a distant prospect.\n\nHome was far from much better, of course. As Merino and his countrymen bayed for blood, it seemed Guzmán alone was the only one who could salvage a fragile future. The Professor's grip wrinkled the letter, and considering the dire consequences if it ever got out, he thought, not first time, of burning it.

The crew grumbled below, restless after weeks stalled, but Wunderlich's mind churned on darker currents - Merino's shadow loomed too large, too restless. He'd seen the captain's glares, heard the venomous rants against Guzmán. Something was coming.\n\nHe gripped the rail, duty warring within him. The constitution swore him to the law, to Guzmán's shaky command, but the chain tethered him to Merino. Wunderlich didn't like the bastard - too loud, too cruel - but these were dark times. Argentina's claws, the OAS's wavering - maybe Merino's iron grip was what Chile needed. Yet the thought soured him. Strength like that birthed monsters, and he'd seen enough already.\n\nCautín flickered in his mind, unbidden - those sweltering woods, the Mapuche blood on his hands. His marines had mowed down the rebels with cold precision, but the screams lingered - farmers, kids, dragged off or worse. He'd followed orders, Merino's then, and the guilt gnawed. Backing him now? More atrocities waited.\n\nThe ice groaned, mocking his indecision. Duty to the law, loyalty to the chain, ghosts of Cautín - they clashed in his chest. Merino's strength could save them, or damn them deeper. Wunderlich spat into the wind, tasting salt and regret. He'd obey, like always - but he'd watch, and wonder how much more blood he could bear."

The clink of cutlery was the only sound until Merino's growl broke it. \"Fucking ice - trapping us like frozen bananas while those dung-brained troglodytes in Santiago sip wine. We're late, Covián - too damn late.\"\n\nHis voice carried the old venom, the Adelaide massacre still a raw wound - those varmints butchering Chilean blood, spitting on sovereignty. But his usual edge had blunted, the fervor of his dehumanizing insults gone hollow by weeks of drift. He shoved the plate aside, eyes glinting. \"I've half a mind to ram this tub through, coup be damned. Guzmán's a fossil - weak, blind - but is it even worth it? These delays... maybe the whole plan's a fool's errand\".\n\nCovián's gaze didn't waver, his tone low and steady. \"No, Captain. The ice tests us. Guzmán falters - Adelaide proves it. You're the blade Chile needs to carve out the rot. It's your path - strike hard, strike now. My loyalty's yours, always. And the marines,\" he smiled \"are ready.\"\n\nMerino snorted, a jagged laugh escaping. \"You're so predictable, Covián - loyal as a dog, but twice as naive. But I can't say no to such enthusiasm.

Normally, the professor would be content to leave the fate of his schemes in the hands of capable underlings, but the sheer enormity of consequences gave Guzmán a sudden realization of just how little control he had.\n\nAnd it terrified him.\n\nFor all his preparation, the great game of nations was beyond the scope of one man. The engine of history ground its mighty gears as it steamed ahead into the oblivion of tomorrow, a thousand-million micro-decisions from an atomic to a geopolitical level all combining into a great incomprehensible mass of consequence. It was beyond him now.\n\nSo, he focused instead on the things that were not beyond him. Like the surplus fuel rations his calculations had just yielded.

This display was only a pantomime of deliberation, as the diplomats pretended to care about the technicalities of the Chilean arguments.\n\nNo, the real diplomatic game would be played in halls outside the conference rooms, in the smoke-filled rooms of hotels, in the palms of bribe-greased handshakes. It was a necessary fiction, an essential decorum to maintain the fiction of a diplomacy rooted in logic and arguments rather than power and money. Still, Villarroel was more than happy to play along as he had so many times before.\n\nA question from the Canadian diplomat broke the monotony of his speech. \"If I understand it correctly, the Chilean representative is claiming that the Treaty of Tordesillas, a 16th-century proclamation issued by the Pope, is somehow more legitimate than that of modern international law? Now, most of my countrymen don't exactly recognize the pope's authority on most matters; why should we do so on this one?\"\n\nVillarroel's eyes lit up as the spotlight shifted back to him; these were the moments he lived for.

The essential element of the treaty is not the authority of the Pope but the strength of our historic rights, rights that are themselves the basis of territorial claims in international law.

Lucila, architect of the modern education system in Mexico. Lucila, giant among Chilean authors, who wrote to him excitedly about her nomination to the Nobel Prize in Literature, always more eloquent than him. Lucila, whose poems moved him to tears now that she was gone.\n\nHe laid the forget-me-nots gently, petals hugging the cool earth. 'Lucila Godoy Alcayaga' was etched on stone, final, frozen, and it still startled him to read that in a cemetery; not signing a fresh letter, or on a headline in the papers, announcing her latest award.\n\nHe told her about changes since then, about the museum established in her old home here in Santiago, and she would have cupped her face in her hand, smirking, listening to tales about the frozen continent and that obstinate Merino, and his upcoming adventure with Miranda. She'd have hummed about not being able to come with him, to traverse the Americas. To visit Doris in New York.\n\n\"She really does love you, my friend,\" he said, light crawling over his back. \"She's taking good care of your work. The whole archive. I'm sure she's told you all about it.\"\n\nHe had to get to the airport on time, he forced himself to remember. Drowsy Santiago greeted him out of the cemetery, a million conversations pouring from its streets. Villarroel swam the rivers of noise, trying to imagine her voice in the crowd, and he found he couldn't quite remember it anymore."

Operation Southern Cross has led to the collapse of Neuschwabenland's defenses. Peripheral German positions have been captured by OFN, Brazilian, and Uruguayan forces. German forces currently hold limited positions in the vicinity of Schirmacher Station.\n\n2. A Brazilian expeditionary force has established a foothold in Coats Land under the command of Admiral Augusto Rademaker, known for his anti-Argentine views. His appointment should be considered a deliberate provocation. The landing was conducted to the east of their official claims on the Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelf, inside the Uruguayan claim. Brazilian Antarctic claims overlap with the eastern areas of the Argentine Antarctic Sector constituting a direct challenge to Buenos Aires.\n\n3. Brazilian forces are in a critical position. Observation confirms a catastrophic lack of winter equipment, suitable living modules, and supplies. Without external assistance, their ability to survive the Antarctic winter and brutal conditions on the fringe of the Weddell Sea is assessed as extremely low.\n\n4. Brazil's presence diverts Argentine resources. However, their refusal to honor their defensive obligations under the Philadelphia Accords during the Snipe War must not be forgotten.

Uruguayan forces have successfully established Artigas Base on the coast, east of the new Brazilian positions. Due to their location, they will become the first line of defense against any potential German counter-attack.\n\n2. Intercepted radio transmissions from Artigas Base confirm requests for heavy weaponry. This data is consistent with prior SIM analysis, gathered from observation of their expedition's ships being loaded in Montevideo, which revealed a severe shortage of anti-tank assets and heavy machine guns. The immense distances involved makes rapid reinforcement extremely difficult.\n\n3. It should also be noted that Uruguay failed to honor its defensive obligations under the Philadelphia Accords when we were attacked by Argentina in 1958. Diplomatic analysis from that time indicated that their inaction was dictated by a desire to maintain stable relations with post-Peronist Argentina and a general unwillingness to enter the conflict over disparate Sub-Antarctic islands and continental positions.\n\n4. Although their strategic relevance against Argentina is limited, a well-defended and friendly Uruguay serves as a valuable buffer, keeping the German threat away from the Trinity Peninsula. Their ability to withstand an attack directly impacts our own security, however any support from us will have to travel vast distances across one of the most inhospitable sections of the Southern Ocean, the Weddell Sea."

Uruguay has recently concluded a treaty with Argentina demarcating each other's borders in the river Uruguay. These treaties built upon the work conducted by Homero Martínez Montero in 1961, who is their current Foreign Minister. Uruguay is wary of risking Argentina's ire.\n\n2. Foreign Minister Martínez is extremely wary of American influence in Latin America, and will no doubt request assurances that the USA is not behind these negotiations.\n\n3. Uruguay's Antarctic claims have languished under German domination for years.

A flight has been chartered out of Los Cerrillos Airport, scheduled for departure at the beginning of the month.\n\nAs with our previous negotiations, we are operating on a one month timeframe, with negotiations to be completed by the end of March.\n\nImportant points to consider when conducting negotiations with Venezuelan officials are as follows:\n\n1.Venezuela's standing as a major producer of oil products necessitates amicable relations with other nations. Our initial fact finding suggests Venezuelan officials are likely to be hesitant about declaring support for our claims due to their oil trade with Argentina. If Venezuela is to back our claims, they will need to know that we are assembling a broad coalition of supporters.\n\n2. As Professor Guzmán's ceaseless requests have made eminently clear, the Chilean Antarctic Territory is in desperate need of a consistent, cheap fuel supply. We are authorizing you to investigate the potential of a subsidized purchase of fuel from Venezuela for use in Antarctica.\n\n3. The final diplomatic point to consider is the expertise of their foreign minister, Marcos Falcón Briceño, in territorial disputes, having cut his teeth on issues concerning the Guyanese border. Briceño is Venezuela's permanent representative to the Organization of American states and is not to be underestimated in your negotiations, however he would make a useful ally."

 antarctica_aac_diplo.17.desc: "Villarroel groaned as he tried to stretch his legs. These repeat flights across the length and breadth of Latin America were starting to take their toll, to say nothing of the endless nights burning the midnight oil poring over barely legible maps. Everything was sore, and from the look on Miranda's face, the feeling was mutual.\n\nVillarroel lit his fifth cigarette of the flight and took a long drag. It reinvigorated him, but only briefly. Very little cut through the fatigue these days. He wondered if he and Miranda had the energy to finish the job they'd started. He knew the work was only going to get harder from here. More talented negotiators, and countries with less of a vested interest in Antarctic affairs created quite a daunting prospect.\n\nA growing pressure in his ears was soon followed by a pop: a telltale sign they were landing in Caracas' Maiquetía International Airport. \"Think they'll pick us up on time?\" Villarroel wondered aloud.\n\n\"After our last trip, I'm ready for anything,\" said Miranda. \"I somehow doubt Venezuela will be as entertaining as Ecuador, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Villarroel. Then, thinking about their impending meeting with Foreign Minister Briceño, added, \"This is going to be a tougher nut to crack. We haven't got nearly as much leverage in these coming negotiations as we did previously. Venezuela, frankly, doesn't have much reason to care about affairs a continent away.\"\n\nMiranda shrugged. \"We'll just have to rely on our natural charisma and charm,\" he said with a wry smile."

 antarctica_aac_diplo.18.desc: "Marcos Falcón Briceño was a short but imposing man. Miranda and Villarroel had the impression that the Venezuelan Foreign Minister could see right through their diplomatic ephemera, and therefore felt the need to deal with him seriously and privately.\n\nTo that end, Briceño brought them to his office in the Foreign Ministry for a talk. The room was richly decorated, sporting fine leather chairs and a dark mahogany desk. A grandfather clock ticked loudly in the corner. Miranda and Villarroel exchanged nervous looks as Briceño carefully perused their proposition. Every tick of the clock furthered the Chileans' anxiety. The seconds felt like minutes, and the minutes, hours.\n\nBriceño neatly gathered the pages, tapped them into symmetry, and laid them carefully on the desk. He looked up at Miranda, then at Villarroel. \"Our nation,\" said Briceño, \"benefits greatly from our trade with Argentina. While your arguments for the legality of your claim have some merit, my government is hesitant to stick its neck out lest the Argentines decide they no longer need our oil. Their fears could be greatly assuaged by confirmation that other members of the Organization of American States have agreed to publicly declare support for Chilean Antarctic claims. Short of that, I'm not sure I can promise anything, gentlemen.\"\n\nMiranda and Villarroel exchanged one final glance as the clock ticked on, and decided on their answer."

He was already wearing one.\n\nThe Chileans' accepted the headwear and donned it as they followed the Foreign Minister through the fence-lined checkpoint.\n\nBriceño had decided to accompany the diplomats personally during their next engagement: a tour of a Venezuelan oil field. \"As you can see,\" he said, \"we operate only the most modern equipment, and we can produce volumes in excess of anything you'd see elsewhere on the continent.\"\n\nMiranda and Villarroel knew this already, their eyes scanning the vast sea of oil derricks. They were here in the hopes of striking a deal with one of the companies operating out of Venezuela for the purposes of supplying the Chilean Antarctic Territory. If the purchase could be subsidised, so much the better.\n\n\"As impressive as these large plants are,\" said Villarroel, \"do you have contacts with any small- to mid-sized producers who could accommodate our relatively modest requirements?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Briceño. \"I know of several who might suit your needs. And I suppose the oil must come cheaply?\"\n\nMiranda and Villarroel puzzled over that. Arturo Prat's budget was miniscule, and any savings were to be pursued, by order of Professor Guzmán. However, pushing their luck on a subsidized arrangement might jeopardize the entire negotiation with Venezuela."

He'd heard some rumour during their time in Venezuela that the foreign minister was fond of studying his opponents in this way, gauging reactions based off faulty premises. \"The Argentines lost any pretence to a legal claim when they used illegal military actions to seize our territory.\"\n\n\"All the same, the Argentine claims are at least as strong as yours, and they do de facto control a majority of the disputed lands.

 antarctica_aac_diplo.22.desc: "Travelling through Port-au-Prince was a stark departure from Miranda and Villarroel's experience in South American capitals. Aside from the city being a gorgeous Caribbean paradise, at least the side they were shown, the Chilean diplomats had to travel in a military convoy under constant supervision by armed guards.\n\nThere would be no casual outdoor dinners or long evening tours of the city. They had a rigid itinerary facilitated by the military personnel. Any deviation, and they'd be taking their lives into their own hands. Arturo Maschke's report had been a bit of an understatement. Haiti felt like it was on the brink of civil war, although given what they had heard from home Chile was not fairing well either at the moment.\n\nThe convoy carried them to a hotel downtown reserved for dignitaries of all stripes. The building was well-defended, with checkpoints on the streets ensuring the identity of passersby as well as foot patrols by soldiers carrying assault rifles. It was clear to Miranda and Villarroel that the Haitian government was taking no chances with the safety of its visiting dignitaries, and for that at least, they were grateful. The Chileans had the distinct impression that diplomacy, insofar as Haiti's domestic affairs were concerned, had completely failed.\n\nThe convoy cleared the checkpoints and pulled up in front of the hotel. Waiting for them on its illustrious front stoop was the foreign minister of Haiti, Louis Price-Mars, who was a bit of an anomaly in his government, being a black man in a government dominated by the \"mulattoes.\" \"Welcome, senors,\" he said in a thick French accent, shaking their hands in turn. \"I trust you had a good trip from the airport?\""

 antarctica_aac_diplo.23.desc: "The Haitian National Palace was aptly named. Far bigger than the government buildings of most nations, it was a stark white structure that gleamed in the noon sun, blinding in its brightness, overwhelming in its opulence. It was a domicile fit for a king, and its current occupants certainly emulated the lifestyle. Ringing the palatial complex was a dizzying array of flora of all colours and sizes, including many imports from far away countries.\n\nMiranda and Villarroel climbed out of their military transport, and flanked by guards, made their way up the steps. On the lawn, they saw the flag of Haiti, and in positions of equal honour, the flags of the Organization of Free Nations and the United States of America.\n\nLouis Price-Mars was waiting for them inside the grand foyer, eager to show them to the room assigned to them for their negotiations. On the way, they saw several American diplomats and even a few soldiers moving to and fro. The hum of activity within the palace was frantic, almost panicked. The Chilean diplomats could feel the tension exuded by everyone present. The civil unrest was evidently reaching a fever pitch in the country.\n\nThey entered the conference room with Price-Mars and took their seats. The Chileans expected the negotiations to go smoothly. The Haitians had also suffered the indignity of an illegal military action during the Dominican invasion of the Hinche province; they'd likely have to take a stand in favour of Chile's claims. \"So, gentleman,\" said the Foreign Minister. \"What do you think of the palace?\""

They departed from their downtown hotel in the requisite military convoy and picked up the Foreign Minister near the National Palace. From there, they took a leisurely drive through many illustrious parts of the city, places where the old colonial architecture dominated.\n\nMiranda and Villarroel knew that this was a heavily curated tour, but there wasn't much to be done about that. They were clearly only being shown the nicer parts of the city, which was not uncommon during diplomatic visits, but given the increasing military presence as they got farther from the political heart of the city, it was safe to assume the places they weren't shown had gotten quite bad.\n\nPrice-Mars was just pointing out a cologne store. \"I highly recommend patronizing this store, gentlemen. It has a fine collection of ambergris perfumes-\" His French drawl was interrupted by the sounds of gunshots from a neighbouring street. The convoy stopped, and chaos broke out. The driver picked up his radio, receiving rapid-fire French.\n\n\"What's going on?\" asked Miranda.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said Price-Mars, his voice suddenly tense. \"Everything is under control. We are to exit the vehicles and move into the cologne shop.\"\n\nAs the trio exited the transport, more gunshots could be heard followed by the faint echoes of screams as they ducked inside the store.

The true symptoms of the turmoil Haiti faced presented themselves here, and there was nothing Price-Mars could do to cover it up, except perhaps try to distract the Chileans by asking about Antarctica.\n\n\"How long have you two spent there?\" the Foreign Minister asked.\n\n\"In total, probably a couple months,\" said Villarroel. \"We usually don't stay there for long. Our duties obviously take us far from its frozen shores.\"\n\n\"What's it like?\"\n\n\"Cold,\" Miranda chuckled. \"But I'd be remiss to deny the place has a beauty of its own. Unspoiled.\"\n\n\"Do you see many penguins?\"\n\n\"Thousands and thousands.\" Miranda's gaze was caught by a pair of burned-out military vehicles on the side of the road, both riddled with bullet holes.\n\n\"So based on your requests, it seems a steady supply of fresh fruit would be a godsend for your men down there. Truly, does it make that much of a difference?\"\n\n\"You've no idea,\" said Villarroel. \"The crews that winter over endure immense hardships, not least of which is one bland palate. The delivery of fresh fruit at season's end buoys the spirit like nothing else.\" Villarroel looked out the window as they neared the plantation, and saw a body by the side of the road. \"So, as for our arrangement regarding the mangoes...\""

The woman had boundless energy and clearly loved her country deeply, eager as she was to show off as much of Cuba as possible before the negotiations began in earnest. Seeing her standing at the prow of the boat, dress fluttering in the breeze, it was hard for Miranda to reconcile the woman he saw with the Revolutionary he knew her to be. But if Arturo Maschke's report was to be believed, he was sure to find out soon just how feisty Sánchez was.\n\n\"I suppose leisurely cruises like this,\" said Sánchez to Villarroel, \"aren't very common in Antarctica.\"\n\nVillarroel smiled. \"You'd be surprised.

The Chilean Ministry of Foreign Relations had been correct: Costa Rican officials unreservedly backed the Chilean claim to Antarctica, no strings attached. Such a thing was as rare as gold in the world of diplomacy.\n\nThe success was due in large part to Miranda and Villarroel's incisive arguments made at the negotiating table. They'd made a compelling case for Chile's claims, honed via years of diplomacy on this particular subject. There were few in the world who could claim to know the geography, topography, and history of Antarctica as well as the seasoned Chilean diplomats.\n\nOn a personal note, laurels aside, it was a welcome break. After years of uphill battles fought to legitimize Chile's claim, they were finally making progress on the merit of the argument itself, rather than any quid-pro-quo.\n\n\"It seems like word is finally starting to spread on its own,\" said Miranda.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Villarroel. \"The Costa Ricans practically rolled out the red carpet for us.

From myriad conversations with Professor Guzmán, it seemed Arturo Prat was dissatisfied with its rather pedestrian brew.

Funds to be allocated for airfare, lodgings, and living expenses within reason. A stipend will also be included for the purchase of goods and services pertaining to the diplomatic mission.\n\nThe goals of the diplomatic envoy are as follows: to secure a public declaration of Mexican support for Chile's Antarctic claims. With a potential OAS conference meeting so soon, Mexico's support could prove critical in gaining wider recognition of our claims.\n\nImportant points to consider when conducting negotiations with Mexican officials are as follows:\n\n1. Mexico's ruling party, the PRI, has a substantial ideological interest in anti-fascism. If we are able to portray ourselves as combating fascist influence in the region, it could be very persuasive. However, be sure not to compromise our stated neutrality.\n\n2. Mexico fancies itself a rising power and would likely see a stake in the Antarctic as a significant prestige boost.\n\n3. Mexico has in recent years, pursued a robust industrialization plan, one that would be greatly bolstered by Chilean strategic metals. This could be a useful bargaining chip, but not one we should give away lightly.\n\nGiven the import of your task, we have deployed additional diplomatic personnel to assist; you will rendezvous at the Mexico City Airport.

As the diplomats entered the waiting limousine, they received their answer and with it a dozen new questions. They were greeted by the politely smiling face of one Miguel Serrano, perhaps the most controversial man in the entire diplomatic corps.\n\n\"Greeting gentlemen, it is a pleasure to meet again, after so much time.\" Neither of the duo had spoken to Serrano in years, allegations of connections to certain fringe organizations during the Second World War had made Serrano something of a pariah in many circles, though no formal reprimands were ever levied. Villarroel accepted Serrano's handshake and gave his awkward greetings, trying to hide the shock. Perhaps Serrano's reputation was better than initially thought to be, given such a prestigious assignment.\n\nAs they drove through the streets of Mexico City, Serrano's eyes were fixed on the streets, in particular the rows of beggars and vagrants. Victims of the Kabuki Effect, no doubt. He broke the silence with an almost wistful tone, \"This city was once the beating heart of the Aztec Empire, where the blood of young virgins was spilled in the vain hope of appeasing pagan deities. That hubris is how a spirited warrior civilization can become a dung-filled crater like this.

Our first demand is a simple one. As you well know, Mexico has long been the torchbearer of opposition to fascism in this hemisphere. We simply want confirmation from Chile that these ideals will be maintained in our diplomatic dealings in the far south.

We, naturally, stand against the encroachment of hostile influences on the Antarctic, but we also must be wary of needlessly antagonizing our neighbors.\"\n\n\"A fair point my friend, but you must understand my country's hesitance to deal with a nation so unsure of its own values.\"\n\nVillarroel thought for a moment before replying with his answer."

Even his family's letters made Covián weary.\n\nMerino's mind raced with worry, frustrated with how he had executed the coup. Instead of consolidating rule, Merino and Covián scoured Guzmán's office for a just cause. It could all peter out, his vision for Chile and its Antarctic foothold. Another bureaucrat would step in, the military would be shut out forever...\n\nMerino ceased his ruminations, instead directing his anger to the various drawers in the desk. He pulled them all the way out, dumping them onto the desk. Pencils, pens, and, thankfully, a correspondence. He started rifling through the letters.\n\n\"Let's see. Family, family, his old college, Santiago, hmmm...the Argentine Antarctic Institute?!\" Merino tore open the letter, it contained everything he could've imagined. Colonel Leal was reaching out in 'good faith' and hoping for a 'peaceful resolution' for the region's territorial disputes. Covián, on the other end of the office, only saw Merino with a letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\"What do you have there, Captain?\" He inquired. The Captain smiled widely, holding the sheet in the air like a newborn."

They'd been cold for days, not enough to risk hypothermia, yet sufficient to force them into a desperate huddle, much to their captor's delight.\n\nWith the whirring and grinding dampening under the starless night, Guzmán sat unsleeping, his thoughts occupied with the weight of his failures. \"Forgive me, my friend, this predicament is all my fault, you do not deserve to suffer in this foul Tartarus for my mistakes.\" He mumbled.\n\nChuckling deliriously, Jaksic answered, \"You must keep your spirits up, Merino has already doomed himself to a court martial with this farcical putsch.

The commander gritted his teeth at the stack of papers laid out before him; such busywork was beneath his station. He began sorting through a tower of unread letters and documents, months' worth of paperwork left untouched in the whirlwind of recent events. As he sorted through the piles of useless bureaucratic drivel his hand found itself on a handwritten letter one personally addressed to him and dated from months ago. He grabbed a letter opener, and after a swift flick of the wrist, he found himself staring at the handwriting of the esteemed diplomat Miguel Serrano. \n\n\"Dear Señor Merino, I first would like to commend you on your continued service to our great nation in its eternal battle to preserve civilization upon that frozen continent. I strive to replicate your heroic deeds in the arena of diplomacy, where so often the wishes of true patriots such as yourself and I are overcome by those whose interests lie elsewhere. If you would permit me a flight of romanticism, I have always held a belief that the destiny of mankind lies in the southern reaches of the planet. In you, I see a man who understands this simple fact, and as such, I see our fates are inextricably linked. If your schedule would allow it I would relish the chance to speak to you personally on how I might best be of service to our shared interests. Please be well, and may the wings of providence carry you to ever greater heights.\n\nMiguel Serrano\".\n\nMerino leaned back in the chair as he contemplated the opportunity he was holding in his hands. Serrano was a man of influence in the Chilean diplomatic corps, an unconventional figure, but one with undeniable skill. More importantly, his childlike admiration for Merino dripped from the pages. If Guzmán had kept a pack of pet diplomats to lick out of his hand, why shouldn't he? He set the letter to one side, grabbed a fresh piece of paper and a pen, and started to write."

Most wouldn't even think of trying to get to Antarctica in such weather, but Contreras wasn't like most. Suddenly, a grey shadow in the snowstorm gave way to a definite shape, a Cessna 336. Merino held his breath; the plane was coming in a bit too fast, and it seemed to wobble as he started its proper descent to the runway.\n\nAs the front wheel made contact with the runway, it held for 100m's then suddenly buckled. Both men watching said a silent prayer, as sparks shot out in either direction and the sound of metal on concrete like nails on a chalkboard echoed out.\n\nAfter thirty excruciating seconds of high-pitched screeching, the plane came to a stop, and both men ran to the plane. As they reached the plane, the door burst open, and the pilot frantically ran to the front with a fire extinguisher while Contreras followed wide-eyed, taking in his new surroundings as if he were a conquistador taking his first steps on virgin lands. He strode off the plane, not even paying attention to the situation to his right before giving a swift salute to his new superiors. \n\n\"Holy shit! Are you okay, man?\" Merino exclaimed. Suddenly, Contreras stopped and looked at him with a wild glint in his eye, one of ambition and opportunity.\n\n\"Gentlemen!

It seemed like even the civvies had to deal with a new rigorous routine. He heard talk that Merino was even recruiting informants, creating his own personal Gestapo to root out the last remnants of Guzmán. Routine bureaucratic procedures now required an additional eight levels of clearance, while entire wings of the base had been locked off to all but the senior officers. Arturo Prat had taken on the air of a prison complex.\n\nMany suspected Merino's new lapdog Contreras was to blame, but he had been a scarce sight on the base since the so-called logistics wizard had arrived. He would grab some food from the mess hall and then scuttle back to Merino's office; whatever was happening, Juan guessed it was big. But the marine couldn't be arsed worrying about what intrigue was being cooked up; instead, as he mixed bleach and hot water in the mop bucket, he thought back to the chess game.

And worst of all, none of them were any closer to understanding just what the Captain was planning.\n\nSure, they all had pieces of the puzzle. Wunderlich knew Contreras was working on retrofitting one of those old whaling vessels. For what purpose, though? Similarly, he had been carrying out an increasingly brutal training regimen handed down from Covián, one emphasizing hostage taking, of all things. He had expected this to be the moment when it was all unveiled. Instead, it was another raving diatribe.\n\n\"Argentinian treachery stabs our people in the back at every opportunity it gets.

For the time being, their hubris serves our purposes. We must keep them drunk on confidence until our trap can be sprung.\" He said, slamming his fist on the table.\n\nA nervous silence lingered over the room, the triumvirate ate playing chicken as to who would spring the question.

They are putting themselves into a very dangerous position, bait for Argentine predators eager to enforce their illegitimate rule.\n\nYears of training had led to this. And yet the whole plan felt anathema to every instinct in his body. He had spent his life learning how to be the hunter, to relentlessly stalk and kill.

Wunderlich kept it simple.\n\n\"You, sir, will be taken prisoner and then immediately sent back to your home country. The same treatment will be afforded to your crew. The ship, on the other hand, is to be confiscated with immediate effect. It is now property of Chilean Antarctica.\"\n\nInfuriated, the Argentine balled his fists.

Wunderlich pulled himself to his feet and spat off the side of the bow, but the taste of acidic bile lingered.\n\nThis gambit had turned into abject chaos practically from the jump. Faulty trigger discipline on the part of the Marines, presumably made worse by panic or hostility, led to shots being fired early. The Argentine sailors, alerted to their presence, responded with their own fire. A bloodless trap turning into a protracted, costly shootout, one which, to Wunderlich's particular shame, did not exclude the civilians in its wake.\n\nIt had ended in a stalemate, but one that hardly favored the Chileans. Their enemy had gotten away, and they had been left to clean up viscera and humiliation. The guilt and exhaustion were making Wunderlich's head spin, he simply wanted to lie down in his cot and never wake up.

He sat helpless as the Argentines started their film projector. The delegates watched in shocked silence as grainy pictures and film of the aftermath of Merino's fiasco were displayed, resplendent, over the shadowy pillars and arcs of the room. An Argentine boy, his face a ripe fruit opened by Chilean gunfire. Soldiers like bloody trash bags sitting in a makeshift hospital. Caskets draped with the blue-white triband of the Sun of May.\n\nHorrified murmurs broke the silence as the projector clicked to a stop. \"Chile decries the overt emotional manipulation at play,\" Villarroel said, eyes obscured by the glare of stark overhead lights.\n\n\"We have simply shown to the Organization that aggression in the Antarctic region is hardly one-sided,\" the young face from Argentina answered.\n\n\"I remind the delegates that this unfortunate incident occurred in Chilean territorial waters, which Argentina's navy illegally treaded upon,\" Villarroel, the gray-haired, soon-to-be retiree, plainly stated.\n\nThe Argentine, clinging to his mic, said, \"And it was triggered by Chilean forces disguised as civilians in a nakedly deceptive operation.\" The corner of his lip upturned. \"An operation which, I might add, failed thanks to the valiant heroism of the Argentine sailors.\"\n\nThe delegates from Uruguay and Ecuador shifted while the Central Americans began a hushed discussion, and the American who approved Argentina's request to play the film smiled with glib satisfaction.

He was definitely not talking to Serrano or Merino, who were ready to throw him out, anyway. To hell with them. They didn't travel half the hemisphere for this moment.\n\nIt had come down to a difference of four votes. Even with the Yanks voting against, they'd done pretty well. The House of the Americas buzzed with movement, flashing cameras capturing Argentina's ascension into the OAS on a probationary basis.\n\nThey also bore witness to a second resolution, however, condemning Argentina's bloody incursion into Adelaide Island, and pledging to uphold Chile's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Villarroel could not complain. They'd shared good food and sincere exchanges with the entire continent, and if that wasn't enough reward in itself, then the red, fuming face from the Argentine delegate made it all worth it.\n\nBut not for Merino. Anything short of standing up and shooting the Argentine delegation in their heads before turning the gun on himself would do. Villarroel knew this, and hauling a tidy suitcase out of the conference, he decided to take the long way around D.C. before heading to the hotel."

Miranda leafed through documents and newspapers, a garbled song on the radio mingling with the hubbub of D.C.'s rush hour.\n\n\"Nothing more we can do,\" Villarroel muttered, \"The Argentines are in.\"\n\n\"It's probationary.\"\n\n\"A consolation prize. The Americans were on everyone's throats. They advocated for Argentina better than we advocated for ourselves.\"\n\nMiranda squeezed Villarroel's shoulder, and the right words took an awful, long moment to come out. \"We did everything we could.\"\n\nBut did they? Would it matter, anyway? This was exactly what Merino wanted: proof that diplomacy was bound to fail and more than enough reason to sack them both. Impetus to continue the militarization of the sector, ignore the resolution, and keep repeating Adelaide over, and over, and over again. And they had no leg to stand against him anymore."

He had not seen a familiar face for days, sustained only by flavorless gruel and tattered rags. Perhaps he had earned his fate for the most damning and treasonous ideology of peace, or Merino's putsch was a sick attempt at humor. But neither matters when the truth, as determined by the tribunal, shall become apparent soon enough.\n\nTurning to the dry, concrete bounds of his cell, Guzmán contemplated on how blind he'd been to the treachery that was so impending. Maybe he does deserve this fate — for trusting a python with his gaping maw, and for looking towards Colonel Leal, an Argentine, as a fellow human. Of so many of the errors he'd made to culminate into this very moment, resting somewhere as ruined as his repute, what else can he blame, really, but his hubris?\n\nJust as his fortress of lawyers and activists working back-to-back, praying for the most minute chance of salvaging this disgraced husk's reputation, a question lingers in the pained Guzmán's forlorn mind: what is a country if her supposed guardians are all so wolflike, always so emboldened to bite hands if they'd find the most minute benefit?\n\nBeing a military installation, the rules of democracy need not apply to the Antarctic lands. But has the caliber of men, of those such as Merino, all entrusted with protecting the institutions of the Chilean nation, really become so debauched and poor that mercy is a sin, and camaraderie is a crime? If this was the state of things in the territories how long would it take to spread back to the homeland?"

Before him lay a stack of papers, routine orders mostly, but one caught his eye: Óscar Pinochet, Villarroel's latest turd polished up for the administration. Merino's lip curled, and he scrawled his signature. \"That prancing dandy,\" he snarled. \"Villarroel's limp-wristed errand boy, some penguin-fondling diplomat with a silver spoon up his ass. Thinks he can leash me? I'll snap his spine and feed him to the seals.\"\n\nHe leaned back, exhaling a cloud of smoke, his mind drifting. The marines were honed now - apex predators of this frozen hell, claws itching to rip out Argentine throats. Argentina slinking into the OAS - those hyenas - proved diplomacy was a gutless farce. The marines would be Chile's teeth now, and Merino their jaw. He pictured Argentine ships splintering under his guns, their flag sinking into the frozen deep. A satisfying start.\n\nBut Serrano's words gnawed at him, those strange, fevered rants about destiny and empire. Crush Argentina, sure - but then what? Chile itself festered, its society decadent, corrupt, buckling under the strain of its own excess. Politicians bickered in Santiago, fat cats gorged on bribes, and the people chafed, restless for something stronger. Merino's fingers drummed the desk. Perhaps Serrano wasn't mad. Perhaps this talk held the truth.\n\nHe stubbed out the cigar, eyes narrowing. First, he'd grind Argentina into paste, take back every inch those filth stole. Then?

A fire raged within him, hotter than any blizzard.\n\n\"I gave you a simple, fucking, simple task! To bait those underdeveloped apes! And what did you do?! You turned a hunt into the pathetic whimpering of a beaten cur!\"\n\nMerino stepped toward Wunderlich, his face an inch from his subordinate's. He hissed, spraying spittle. \"That genetic dead-end of the Southern Cone - they got away! Got away, laughing in our faces! And took our men's lives with them! All for what? I gave you the chance to be a predator, and you came back with your tail between your legs like a kicked cur!\"\n\nWunderlich was silent, his gaze fixed on the grey expanse. The silence only infuriated Merino further.\n\n\"Enough talk.\" An iron grip clamped onto Wunderlich's peacoat collar. Merino dragged him, down creaking metal gangways, deep into the bowels of the ship. They descended deeper, until the air grew heavy and damp with the smell of saltwater and rust. The very same hold where he'd broken the peasants of Cautin.\n\nMerino threw Wunderlich inside with force. Staggering, he saw it. A rusty chair. Dark stains. Two shadows emerged from behind the captain - loyal marines.\n\n\"Weakness, Corvette Captain,\" Merino's voice was deceptively calm. \"That's your problem.

It wouldn't be long before word reached the wider world of Merino's farcical putsch attempt. His carefully cultivated image of Chile's quiet, efficient governance on the continent was thrown in a woodchipper by that jumped-up Bonaparte. But it wasn't just Chile's reputation the captain had endangered. Argentina had been growing bolder of late, as Adelaide had so clearly shown; he shuddered to think what they would do when they finally smelled the weakness emanating from Arturo Prat.\n\nGuzmán found himself pulled out of his thoughts when he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned and was face to face with Jaksic, cigarette hanging out his mouth and carrying a bundle of folders in his arms.\n\n\"Look on the bright side, my friend, sanity prevailed as it so rarely does down here,\" Jaksic said with a reassuring smile as he set the folders on the map and started spreading it out. Guzmán took a deep breath and sighed, he wished he could share his friend's optimism. But it was a cold comfort when he was faced with the uncertainty of the future.\n\nAll that could be done now is to try and take care of any remaining plotters and batten down the hatches for winter.

Professor Guzmán entered alone, closing the door behind him.\n\n\"Captain,\" Guzmán began, his voice low and tired, devoid of triumph. \"An explanation is required. Attempting armed insurrection against the lawful administration.... What possessed you?\"\n\nMerino stared straight ahead, a muscle twitching in his jaw. He offered no reply, only the faint, arrogant curl of his lip.\n\nGuzmán sighed, rubbing his temples. \"Did you truly believe your men would follow you into treason?\"\n\nSilence stretched, broken only by the distant hum of the base generator. Merino shifted slightly, crossing his arms, his gaze flicking dismissively towards Guzmán before settling back on the opposite wall.\nGuzmán tried a different tack. \"Your accusations against me... baseless fabrications to justify this lunacy?\"\n\nMerino finally spoke, his voice a low sneer. \"I answer to the patriots. Not to desk-bound parasites who lick Argentine boots and consort with socialists.\"\n\nGuzmán felt a flash of anger, but quickly suppressed it. Trading barbs with this man was pointless, degrading.

Twenty seconds.\n\nThen, the radio crackled back to life. \"Professor Guzmán, Santiago Command copies your report.

Professor Guzmán stood aside, arms folded, his weathered face schooled into calm. Inside, trust eroded - he saw Covián as Merino's shadow, a rabid hound bred on the same contempt for civilians, communists, and Argentines. Yet Guzmán hid it well.\n\nCovián was escorted to his new office - Merino's former cabinet, its maps still tacked up, cigar ash dusting the floor. Guzmán trailed behind, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. He didn't trust Covián, not a damn inch, but he trusted the man's greed. Ambitious little man - always had been. Promotions, authority, a shiny title to polish his ego - that'd keep him leashed.\n\nCovián stepped inside, surveying the space with clinical precision. His voice cut through, low and detached. \"The marines are raw iron yet - discipline firms, but their edge demands sharpening. Within months, they will break the enemy's will. All I need is your order.\" His gaze slid to Guzmán, steady, unblinking.\n\nGuzmán's smirk faded, though his nod was curt. Covián was good - too good, maybe - molding Merino's marines into a machine of cold brutality. Loyal to a fault, sure, but that loyalty had been to Merino. Still, self-interest was a tether stronger than ideals. Guzmán turned for the door. \"Keep the peace, Covián. That's my order.\" He didn't look back - trust was a luxury, but control wasn't."

As well as an official promotion to the rank of Frigate Captain. Congratulations!\" Guzmán stated loudly as he attached the medal to Wunderlich's uniform, and the crowd of fellow Marines broke out in applause. When Wunderlich gave Guzmán a crisp salute, the band played the national anthem, and Wunderlich tried to keep his shivering to a minimum. As he did this, he couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt at the acclamation. While he knew in his heart he had made the right choice, the award rang hollow. His fifty pieces of silver for betraying the sacred bonds of the chain of command.\n\nEven the promotion had an air of corrupt utilitarianism about it. The only reason he had taken this coveted position was to fill out the ranks of those who'd be court martialed. Then, there was also training them in the new doctrine. Merino tried making the marines into an offensive force, but now with new allies who set up bases in Chilean territory, the apex predator had been tamed into a mere guard dog. A dog under a tight leash, as civilian authorities sought to root out the last of Merino's influence.\n\nOut in the crowd of celebrating marines, he spotted Covián, who was applauded, with a barely concealed grimace.

He swung the bottle firmly against the steel prow. Instead of a satisfying shatter, there was a dull thud. The dark red liquid inside didn't spray; it solidified almost instantly upon contact with the metal, coating the bow in a bizarre, frozen smear. A few awkward coughs broke the silence before a deckhand hurried forward with a scraper and steaming water hose to clean the embarrassing glaze. Jaksic managed a tight smile. \"A true Antarctic christening, Professor.\"\n\nDeep under the waves, where the crushing pressure kept the world dim and silent save for the distant songs of its kin, a new vibration intruded. Unnatural, rhythmic, growing steadily louder - a persistent pulse cutting through the familiar currents. It was the thrum of something hard and relentless moving through the upper waters, a presence that didn't belong in the vast, fluid emptiness. Curiosity urged the Big Blue upwards towards the light. For a timeless moment, only the vast grey sky registered. Then, awareness focused on the hard shape nearby, the source of the vibration. Small, dark figures moved upon it.\n\nA sudden, sharp crack echoed through the water, followed instantly by an agonizing tearing deep within its flank. Instinct screamed dive - escape into the familiar darkness below. But as its powerful flukes drove it downwards, a terrible, alien weight resisted, pulling relentlessly upwards.

Covián stood motionless, his gaze fixed upon the documents Guzmán had presented. Jaksic leaned forward, absorbing every detail with a calculated intensity. Guzmán methodically laid out the facts: the unprovoked nature of the attack, the evidence of Argentinian military presence discovered by Wunderlich, the aircraft wreckage recovered by the Marines, and the blatant violation of Chilean sovereignty.\n\n\"The evidence is incontrovertible,\" Guzmán stated, his voice even despite the turmoil churning within him. \"Argentina attacked us without provocation or justification.\" He tapped the thick dossier. \"I am forwarding copies immediately to Miranda and Villarroel in Punta Arenas.

Pushing past jagged sheets of ice and ripped fabric, they peered inside the main building.\n\nThe dim light revealed a scene of mass tragedy. Bodies lay huddled together for warmth that never lasted, slumped over overturned equipment, caught in the final postures of succumbing to the lethal cold. One man's stiff hand clutched a simple wooden rosary. The scale of the loss was staggering - the entire complement, it seemed. They hadn't stood a chance against the storm.\n\nOn a debris-strewn table, pinned beneath a frozen toolkit, lay a single sheet of paper. A note. One marine carefully picked it up, his breath frosting as he read it. It spoke of the failing generator, dwindling fuel flown in too late, of listening to radio silence while the storm raged. It ended not with prayer, but with a bitter curse directed northwards, blaming negligence and broken promises.\n\nFor Wunderlich, the journey back was a torment. The hopeful resolve he'd felt had shattered, replaced by sharp self-recrimination. Too slow? Was this rescue mission doomed by flawed planning even before the storm hit? The questions circled relentlessly. He didn't have answers, only the crushing weight of the outcome. If only things had been different, but this was cursed Wiencke, where the only thing that endures are gravestones.\n\nBack at Arturo Prat, Guzmán received the news in heavy silence, overseeing the dignified handling of the remains destined for Callao."

A profound injustice, no question.\" He paused, letting Guzmán absorb the acknowledgment before continuing. \"But look at it this way. He is discharged. His career is finished. He tried to seize power and failed.

He could say his coffee spilled because of gravity, but only magic could lift the undeserving Argentines to the OAS.\n\nAnd yet. He got on his knees and started to clean up, wishing he could have received the news from Villarroel and Miranda in person. They could always ease his anxiety with a quip or two.\n\n\"Only the Americans can perform magic,\" Villarroel would say.\n\nGuzmán's hands trembled. That's the kind of influence they were pit against. He went for the drink cabinet, and a few minutes later was already typing away and downing his second shot.\n\nThey couldn't stop Argentina if it had Washington on its side, but he could be a thorn on their side.

It was Adelaide's composition, and Chile's victory march.\n\nInside his room, covering the bed from corner to corner, photographic evidence of the massacre. Dozens of pictures of damaged equipment, charred buildings, and the bloated, frost-bitten faces of his brothers. Villarroel would sit and go through them whenever his fingers hurt too much to keep typing, burning red marks near bleeding.\n\nSome of them had no names - still unidentified. He made a point of learning the others, rubbing his wrists, and doing and undoing his tie.\n\nHis chair swiveled, and he got back to work. Tak-tak-tak, his extensive dossier of the Adelaide massacre grew. So did his other arguments against the Argentine candidacy.

He would let them peek at the folder under his arm while discussing popping hors d'oeuvres into his mouth. Miranda relived their transcontinental journey that night, dancing from table to table.\n\nHour past hour, a circle grew and followed after him. Eventually, even the waiters would stop to glance at the pictures - Miranda supposed they would be the first civilians abroad to find out about the Adelaide massacre. Reactions were always the same—stunned silence, at first, as they were met with the faces of victims in grainy pictures. Then, outrage, murmured questions, condolences given.\n\nMiranda answered everything with a shake of the head. \"Only remember what you've seen when the time to vote arrives.\"\n\nHe glanced the way of the two men who never came to see the dossier; the American and Argentine delegates.

What he hadn't anticipated was a gleaming golden medal. The Order of the Sun, the highest honor the Peruvian state can bestow, to be given to Professor Guzmán at the earliest opportunity. This was followed by an astonishingly long bow from the ambassador and an accompanying round of applause.\n\nSuch was the beginning of negotiations with the Peruvian envoy to the OAS. Villarroel almost felt forced to ask, \"Why so much enthusiasm, Ambassador? We just did our job in, nothing more?\"\n\nThe Peruvian looked at him like he had grown two heads, then chuckled. \"I expect more wit from you, ambassador. You can't go and save the lives of our countrymen and then act perplexed when her people are thankful. I know Guzmán was just doing his duty, as were the marines, but we Peruvians appreciate it nonetheless.\"\n\nHumbled, the Chileans nodded. The diplomat continued to speak: \"Please assure Professor Guzmán of my profound gratitude and regards, both on behalf of the government of the Republic of Peru and as a Peruvian private citizen. Moreover, Messrs. Miranda and Villarroel, you can be assured that Lima will back your efforts in respect to Argentina to the hilt.\"\n\nMiranda bowed from his seated position. \"Thank you very much, Ambassador, both for your kind words and for your support. We will do all we can to make this worth your while.\"\n\n\"Oh, no need, no need; you already did.\" Leaning in as if to whisper in Villarroel and Miranda's ears and speaking sotto voce, the Peruvian delegate quipped, \"God, it's even a pleasure.

How can Santiago expect support from Lima after Santiago's own men in Antarctica fumbled a knife into Lima's back in the way they did?\"\n\nPulling out angry letters from the families and colleagues of the deceased, he all but shoved them in Miranda's face. \"You know what these letters say? That your boss Guzmán is a fool and a negligent, unprepared halfwit. Why in God's name did he welcome our scientists to Antarctica if he had even the slightest inkling that a tragedy like this was possible? Does he find a sick pleasure in leaving people to die in the cold?\"\n\nAt last, the diplomat calmed down a little. \"No, gentlemen, we aren't going to waste a whit of effort on people who didn't lift a finger to help us. The only reason we aren't supporting whatever Buenos Aires has to say instead is because Guzmán at least had enough morals left in him to repatriate my compatriots' remains in an honourable manner.\n\nFaced with the Peruvian's diatribe, all that the members of the Chilean delegation could do was hang their heads. \"No use saying sorry to him,\" Villarroel thought. \"He knows we're sorry, already—but sorry won't bring his people back. God damn it, if only the marines had been better prepared...\""

They had already played their hand. Now, they only needed to let the wave of international condemnation run its course. When the Argentinian ambassador tried to interject comments about \"provocations\" or \"ambiguities in demarcation,\" Villarroel firmly cut him off: \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Ambassador, but the dossier contains the precise coordinates for Adelaide, situated within recognized Chilean Antarctic territory. What ambiguity could there possibly be?\"\n\n\"To attempt to portray this as anything other than what it is,\" the Colombian delegate declared, his voice rising again, \"is an insult to the intelligence of everyone assembled here!\"\n\nThe Argentinian tried appealing to Pan-American solidarity, to the necessity of unity against \"external threats,\" but his words rang hollow against the weight of the undeniable facts. He was trapped.\n\nIt was then, precisely when it became clear that no excuses would suffice, that the word \"reparations\" was spoken. The Argentinian ambassador lowered his gaze, his shoulders slumping in defeat. A nod, almost imperceptible, was his sole response. Argentina would pay. Miranda and Villarroel exchanged a look."

Beside him, Villarroel tensed almost imperceptibly.\n\n\"...however, we must consider the full complexity of the situation and the necessity of maintaining dialogue among all members of our organization,\" the Venezuelan continued, receiving approving nods from several other delegates.\n\nWhat had begun as a wave of potential condemnation following their compelling presentations shattered against the reefs of political expediency. The Argentinian ambassador, who only moments before had looked cornered, now sat up straighter. His objections about a \"tragic misunderstanding\" and the \"need for a bilateral investigation\" suddenly began to find a more receptive audience.\n\nMiranda and Villarroel caught snippets of murmured phrases: \"...pushing too hard...\", \"...remember how the Americans railroaded that last resolution through?...\", \"...let's not set a precedent for intervention...\" It became clear: payback for past US pressure, a reluctance to rock the boat, their own hidden agendas - all of it proved more important than principle.\n\nThe Argentinian allowed himself an almost imperceptible smile as the chairman announced the lack of consensus on the matter of reparations. He stood, gave a polite nod to the chamber, and headed for the exit.\n\nIn silence, Miranda and Villarroel began gathering their papers. They had a dispatch to send to Guzmán.

He looked at the lights of Arturo Prat Base and saw not what was, but what could be.\n\nWhat if these temporary modules and barracks finally became a complete picture? In his mind's eye, the outlines of the base shifted and changed, giving way to permanent structures, new streets, and scientific laboratories. He could almost hear the hum of generators, powering a true Chilean settlement, wrested from the continent's icy grip. A place where one could not only survive, but live.\n\nAnd should it all end there? His gaze drifted further, beyond the base, towards the horizon. There, where now was only a white void, his imagination painted new flags, fluttering alongside the Chilean one. In his dream, Chilean Antarctica became a welcoming home for all the nations of Latin America seeking the peaceful exploration of the last continent.\n\nAnd all this would be fueled not by pitiful handouts from distant Santiago, oh no! Guzmán saw a bustling port, where an entire fleet of whaling and fishing vessels were moored. New processing stations sprang up along the coast, and the acrid smell of whale oil mixed with the salt wind. He hoped that one day, when their dream had taken root in this ice, they could find another way. A path that did not demand such a bloody tribute from the depths.\n\nThe vision faded as suddenly as it had appeared.

So the next group of scientists could freeze to death with slightly more advanced instruments in their hands?\n\nA welcoming home for all the nations of Latin America...

His thoughts were a blur. It was all meaningless. Every plan, every sleepless night, every compromise... it all just led to more bodies in the snow.\n\nSuddenly, there was a gentle knock on the door. \"Julio? It's me, Carlos. Are you in there?\" Jaksic's voice was quiet, concerned.\n\nThat sound, that note of concern, broke something inside Guzmán. Sympathy? He didn't deserve it. A blind, irrational rage overwhelmed him. He grabbed the pisco bottle and, without aiming, hurled it at the door.\n\nThe glass shattered with a crash, spattering the wall with alcohol.\n\n\"GET OUT!\" Guzmán rasped, his voice alien and cracked. \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\"\n\nSilence fell on the other side of the door.

 antarctica_aac_observers.1.desc: "\"There is one more thing to discuss, sir,\" Covián said, standing beside his seat, forcing the officers filtering out of the room to freeze in their tracks. They awaited Merino's verdict, the general's silhouette like a condor before his vast window view of Arturo Prat.\n\nHe raised an eyebrow, and with it dismissed the lower ranks. \"Quickly.\"\n\n\"Considering our present situation, I believe it ideal to send a military attaché abroad to observe the realities of modern amphibious warfare.\"\n\nMerino tilted his head, sneering. \"Did you have something specific in mind, or are you wasting my precious time with vagaries?\"\n\n\"The ongoing war in the Levant, sir,\" said Covián, and Merino's smile fell. \"We should send a small observer group to Turkey, if the Turks allow it, and learn from their experiences.\"\n\nMerino's shadow crawled over the room. He rounded the long table, hands behind his back. \"We cannot spare a single man, Covián. I won't waste them in the mainland, let alone some Arab hellhole. The Argentines are treacherous. If they sense even the slightest opening...\"\n\nThe henchman did not budge. \"The Turks are fighting the same Italian guns that our neighbors threaten us with. It's convenient that we have close relations with them. Chile was first in the region to recognize their Republic way back when.\"\n\nA pause, as Merino stepped back. They both surveyed the glaring lights along Arturo Prat's ice corridors. \"Our soldiers cannot remain ignorant virgins to combat.\"\n\nMerino's fingers drummed at his side. The general turned to his junior and said,"
 antarctica_aac_observers.1.a: "\"A small contingent. Nothing more and nothing less.\""
 antarctica_aac_observers.1.b: "\"There are no resources to spare. Chile's future is here, not there.\""
 antarctica_aac_observers.2.t: "Arrival in Ankara"
 antarctica_aac_observers.2.desc: "The white crescent and star flowed over cascading red banners. Signs decrying Italian aggression and exalting the defense of the homeland furnished Ankara's apartments. Parting the crowds of Atatürk Boulevard were a group of strange tourists: marines donning Chile's uniforms. They dodged a boy chasing other kids with an oversized gas mask, and saluted a grandpa whose old soldier's garb sagged with medals.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Grosser was pretending not to be lost, hefting a suitcase-full of documents ahead of his men into Kızılay Square. They followed a paper effigy of the Duce with his pants down, surfing the crowd with hordes of balloons, and arrived at a corner taken by Turkish officers.\n\n\"First Lieutenant Grosser, of the Chilean delegation,\" he parroted what he rehearsed the entire flight. That was his only line. He sputtered in awkward Turkish, \"We were just told to meet an officer by the name of...\"\n\n\"Aybar,\" said a young man with a trim mustache, offering his hand. \"How do you like my country so far, sir?\"\n\nBefore Grosser could answer, stuttering trumpets and drums led the Turkish Marine's entrance. Rows and rows of men in spotless dress uniforms came thundering down the street. Aybar saluted them as they marched through a makeshift arc that read: \"TO THE LEVANT OUR HEROES GO.\"\n\n\"My men,\" he declared, chest swelling. Grosser nodded and observed. He'd been picked by Covián to lead the observers because of that skill. Orders were to prepare reports for every single day of the mission, \"regardless of whether you see action or not.\" Already, a leading thought came to mind."
 antarctica_aac_observers.2.a: "The formation is immediately ready for deployment. They've prepared to act fast."
 antarctica_aac_observers.2.b: "They maintain stiff discipline under searing heat. Grim faced, even with the adoring crowd."
 antarctica_aac_observers.2.c: "The whole of Ankara is primed for battle. Fury is in the air."
 antarctica_aac_observers.2.d: "Every soul in the crowd has the soldiers in their hearts. The men will lay their lives on the line in exchange."
 antarctica_aac_observers.3.t: "Combat Experience"
 antarctica_aac_observers.3.desc: "Black smoke and brimstone strangled his lungs. They were huddling for cover behind sharp rocks, bit by bit eroded by gunfire.\n\n\"They knew we were coming,\" Aybar shouted. Water lapped around their shoulders. The marines glared under steel helmets reflecting white sunlight. \"You should have stayed on the boat, sir.\"\n\n\"I am here to observe combat,\" Grosser yelled in broken Turkish, over a screeching machine gun. Merino and Covián wouldn't be satisfied by faraway commentary. \"Ignore me and lead!\"\n\nAybar forced his way through the crashing waters, bent as he spoke to the men clinging to their rifles, hugging the rock. \"I want suppressing fire there\" - he pointed at the Italian pillboxes overlooking the coastal airfield - \"and there. Second and third squads will forge ahead. Grosser, with me. Give them hell!\"\n\nThey clambered the steep, blackened shore, a back and forth of iron hail above their backs. A bullet bounced off of Grosser's helmet. One boy, pierced on a misplaced hand, fell screaming into the waves. Grosser assumed him as good as dead, but the marines forced him back to his feet, crimson coating their bodies, and carried him back to cover.\n\n\"Around the runway, to the control station,\" hissed Aybar. Second and third squads split. They zigzagged through cratered inclines while first squad finished off the machine-gun positions. Fleeing Italians were mowed down on the tarmac, deeper and deeper into the base.\n\nThey stormed the buildings. A roaring, beady-eyed Italian hurled himself at Aybar with nothing but a knife. It scraped his throat and arms. A round of fire riddled the attacker with holes. Screaming, they burst into the radio room only to find an operator with raised, trembling hands.\n\nOn the way back to ship, Aybar lit the cigarettes of all the comrades. Those who had survived. Silently, they dropped the smoking butts into the water. Grosser watched a trail of ash behind them, the airfield left to burn in amber."
 antarctica_aac_observers.3.a: "The only reason they were alive, he realized, was being quick on their feet."
 antarctica_aac_observers.3.b: "Zipping bullets and pointed rocks had failed to stop them. The smoke no longer burned his lungs."

 antarctica_aac_observers.4.t: "Turkey to Antarctica"
 antarctica_aac_observers.4.desc: "The barracks of Arturo Prat were unusually lively. First Lieutenant Grosser sat at the head of a long table, smiling, watching his companions reminisce between rounds of cackling and shots of Rakı. A pretty girl in Ankara, the amenities offered by their Turkish Marine hosts, and the Mediterranean sun were the topics of the night.\n\nWhat else could they talk about, here in Antarctica? No pretty girls in Antarctica. \"No women at all,\" cried out the drunkest officer. The amenities were the best they could be, them being officers, and they still downed their fill of bland fish, barely warmed up by the unreliable heater. And the sun? They wouldn't even discuss the sun.\n\nA shadow loomed out of the table. Covián did not interrupt the chatter, only glanced at Grosser, and stepped outside. Grosser's chair whined as he rushed to his feet. Out in the cold, bathed by stark white lights, he did miss the broken heater of the barracks.\n\n\"You will report to Merino tomorrow at the first hour. He is out on patrol today.\" Covián gave him a silent, lengthy stare.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I'll have much to elaborate upon with my submitted reports. The experience was truly enlightening.\"\n\n\"I'd expect it to be,\" Covián humphed. \"Turkey must have won the war for a reason.\"\n\nThe slightest smile broke on Grosser's face. The news had finally arrived, and Turkey was victorious. He would have to send congratulations to Aybar. Practicing how to write in Turkish would pay off. \"Indeed.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" Covián began, hiding gloved hands in his pockets. \"What was it that helped them conquer?\""
 antarctica_aac_observers.4.a: "\"They outpaced the enemy with rapid response and quick thinking on the battlefield.\""

 antarctica_aac_observers.5.t: "Report Day"
 antarctica_aac_observers.5.desc: "First Lieutenant Grosser tried not to let his uncomfortable shifting show. Captain Merino, petty aides on one side and Covián on his right, sat before him like teachers before a troubling student.\n\n\"The Turks have lost the damn war,\" spat Merino. \"It may be due to their national character. Or perhaps their faith. Do we still have something to learn from them?\"\n\nGrosser thought of Aybar, and the battle for the airfield. He thought of the people of Ankara and the men lost in the Levant. He held back a more biting response. \"I believe so, sir.\"\n\n\"We are all ears, Lieutenant,\" Covián said, nodding. \"Regardless of the war's outcome, I'm sure there was benefit to watching bloodlessly.\"\n\n\"You will find in my reports detailed observations. The performance of the Turkish Marines was exemplary even as the rest of the war effort failed around them. Although our way of doing things should be maintained, taking a page from their book can only help us against Argentina.\"\n\nMentioning the hated enemy seemed to spike Merino's interest. He reclined in his seat, leafing through the papers. \"How can we avoid their fate?\" he finally asked, gravely. Grosser cleared his throat."
 antarctica_aac_observers.5.a: "\"We must learn to be spry and agile, always quicker than the enemy.\""

UPCOMING UNSC RESOLUTION AIMS TO ESTABLISH UNIFIED OFN COMMAND...\n\nThe teletype ribbon was cold in his hands. Covián reread the message. Friendly fire. Disorganization. A coalition of strangers, trying to act as a single army and failing. For most, it would be a headline about failure. For Covián - a fascinating case study.\n\nFor him, the burning savannah of Africa was the perfect, bloody experiment. While Captain Merino was bogged down suppressing the rebellion on the mainland, here in Antarctica, a real war could be planned. A war against the allies of Germany. Germany - the patron of those degenerates in Buenos Aires. The OFN was learning to fight them, paying for each lesson with blood and costly mistakes. This was a chance to learn the same lessons without paying for them with the lives of Chilean marines.\n\nEyes were needed. His eyes. He picked up the internal telephone. \"Send First Lieutenant Grosser to me.\"\n\nGrosser. A man with an impassive, almost clinical gaze. In battle, he wouldn't see heroism or horror. He would see only what was necessary. Weaknesses in formation. The speed of artillery reloading. The efficiency of supply chains. He was the perfect instrument for the task.\n\nBut to send him meant weakening the already-stretched defenses. To leave a valuable officer in this icy fortress or to risk him for knowledge that could prove priceless? Covián weighed the options with the cold calm of a surgeon deciding whether to amputate a leg to save a life."

The Americans, the South Africans... their left hand didn't know what the right was doing. But their power... their ability to move troops and strike from the air was overwhelming.

 WORLD_Antarctica.1.d: "The frayed, jumbled notes of Chile's national anthem echoed across the southern continent today, as Captain José Toribio Merino announced to his homeland, and its Argentine rivals, that the Chilean Antarctic territory has come under his management. Merino claimed to have foiled an \"Argentino-Bolshevist conspiracy\" inside the previous administration, and arrested Professor Guzmán and his aides. Their status is currently unknown.\n\nThe Chilean Armed Forces have opened a new, confrontational stage in Antarctica, discarding the diplomatic process the Chilean Antarctic Institute had tried to build through the OAS, and vowing to avenge the losses of the Snipe War, whatever the cost. For Merino and his marines, the continental underdogs, the path to reclaim Chile's lost territories is one lined with ice-cold bloodshed."

The officer and his circle allegedly hoped to overthrow the territorial administration and trigger a war with Argentina to avenge the losses of the Snipe War.\n\nProfessor Guzmán and the Chilean Antarctic Institute have put their faith in diplomacy to mend Chile's precarious position in Antarctica, with a lightning diplomatic campaign throughout the Americas to tip the scales in the OAS against Argentina. Overcoming internal threats, it seems Guzmán will remain resilient in pursuing peaceful solutions for Antarctica."
